"""ToolObservabilityMiddleware — tool-call KPI timer + audit events for EVERY
tool call the graph executes (#2011).

Why this module exists:
- `ContextAwareTool` (`fred_runtime.common.context_aware_tool`) used to be the
  ONLY place emitting `agent.tool_latency_ms` / `agent.tool_failed_total` KPI
  and `agent.tool.invocation.{started,completed}` audit events. It is only
  ever instantiated by `mcp_toolkit.py`, i.e. only for MCP-catalog tools.
  Native capability tools (e.g. `DocumentAccessCapability`'s
  `search_documents_using_vectorization`, a plain `@tool`-decorated function
  shipped on the capability's own `AgentMiddleware.tools`) never passed
  through `ContextAwareTool` at all, so they produced zero KPI samples and
  zero audit events — a real gap in the "every tool invocation is audited"
  guarantee documented in `docs/swift/platform/OBSERVABILITY-AND-AUDIT.md`
  §9.
- `AgentMiddleware.awrap_tool_call` is the one chokepoint `create_agent`'s
  `ToolNode` routes every tool call through, regardless of whether the tool
  came from the MCP toolkit or a capability's own middleware. Centralizing
  here fixes the gap for every tool at once, instead of patching each tool
  source separately.

Semantics preserved from `ContextAwareTool` (do not drift from these):
- metric names `agent.tool_latency_ms` / `agent.tool_failed_total` are
  unchanged — Grafana dashboards built against them keep working, just with
  full coverage now
- audit outcome is one of `"succeeded"` | `"failed"` | `"cancelled"` — never
  `"refused"`. A HITL-refused proposal is turned back to the model by
  `FredHitlMiddleware.aafter_model` (via `jump_to: "model"`) before the tool
  node — and therefore this middleware — ever runs, so a refusal never
  produces a `"started"` event (a proposal is not an action, see
  `docs/swift/platform/OBSERVABILITY-AND-AUDIT.md`)
- never log tool arguments, tool results, or any raw content here — only
  identifiers and bounded outcome/error fields

Known gap NOT closed by this middleware (flagged, not fixed, here — see
#2011 follow-up discussion): `ContextAwareTool._run`/`_arun` deliberately
catches exceptions raised by the underlying MCP tool call and returns a
formatted error STRING instead of raising (see its "CRITICAL: Return error
as text to preserve chat history integrity" comment). LangChain's `BaseTool`
machinery only sets `ToolMessage.status="error"` when a `ToolException` (or
another exception `handle_tool_errors` catches) actually propagates out of
`_run`/`_arun` — since `ContextAwareTool` never raises, `awrap_tool_call`
here sees a normal, successful `handler(request)` return for these
already-caught MCP-adapter failures, and reports them as `"succeeded"`. This
narrow case regressed relative to `ContextAwareTool`'s own previous internal
instrumentation (which wrapped the raw underlying call directly and could
see the exception before it was swallowed). Fixing it would require either
raising `ToolException` from `ContextAwareTool` (a behavior change to the
"never orphan a tool call" design) or a structured error signal in the
returned content/artifact — out of scope for this change; see the
implementation report for #2011.

How to use:
- always part of the frame, positioned next to `TracingKpiMiddleware` (see
  `frame.py` for the exact slot and why)

        Per-tool-call ReBAC re-check (RUNTIME least-privilege gap, see
        docs/swift audit): `_authorize_execution_or_raise` (agent_app.py)
        verifies CAN_READ on the turn's team exactly once, at turn start.
        Every tool call after that — potentially many, in a long ReAct loop —
        ran unchecked, trusting that one decision for the rest of the turn.
        This re-runs the same OpenFGA check at the one chokepoint every tool
        call already passes through, so a stale/dropped team membership (or a
        tool call scoped to a different team than the one authorized at turn
        start) is caught here instead of silently trusted.

        Uses the low-level `check_permission_or_raise` primitive (subject/
        resource references, no `KeycloakUser`) because only the portable
        `user_id`/`team_id` strings are available at this layer — the
        personal-team self-heal and org-team bootstrap already ran once at
        turn start for this exact team_id, so skipping them here is safe.

        `is_service_agent` mirrors the *other* branch `_authorize_execution_or_raise`
        takes at turn start (RFC EVAL-AUTH, Solution A): the evaluation worker's
        service identity is authorized without any OpenFGA tuple, so re-running
        the ReBAC check here would reject an identity that was never meant to
        hold one. The flag is computed once from the trusted JWT at turn start
        and threaded through `PortableContext.baggage` — never re-derived from
        anything caller-supplied at this layer.

        resource a tool argument may reference (e.g. a document_uid) — that
        remains each downstream service's own responsibility (several already
