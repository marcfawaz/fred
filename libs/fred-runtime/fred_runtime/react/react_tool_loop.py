ReAct execution loop built on LangChain `create_agent` (#1972).

Why this module exists:
- keep `react_runtime.py` focused on Fred runtime orchestration
- isolate the one place where the stock `create_agent` loop is assembled with
  the fixed platform middleware frame (`middleware/`): message hygiene,
  model routing, dynamic prompting, tracing/KPI, human tool approval, and the
  optional per-turn tool-call limit

History note (#1972):
- this module used to wire the hand-rolled 4-node StateGraph
  (`support/tool_loop.py build_tool_loop`); the loop is now stock
  `create_agent` and all custom node logic lives in the middleware frame.

    Build the compiled ReAct agent: `create_agent` + the platform middleware frame.

    Why this exists:
    - plain ReAct and HITL share one execution model for message memory, tool
      execution, and deterministic filesystem continuation
    - approval is one middleware gate inside that loop, not a separate runtime

    How to use:
    - pass the already selected model, bound tools, and the composed runtime
      system prompt
    - include the current runtime tool names so filesystem follow-up context can
      be rebuilt and enforced per turn
    - `capability_middleware`/`capability_hitl` come from one
      `fred_runtime.capabilities.assembly.CapabilityAgentBlock` (#1973):
      the id-sorted capability stacks for the frame's reserved slot, and the
      `HitlSpec` bindings for the single approval gate; capability tools ride
      on their middleware (`AgentMiddleware.tools`), so `tools` stays the
      platform-resolved set

    Example:
    - `build_tool_loop_compiled_react_agent(..., available_tool_names={"ls", "read_file"})`
