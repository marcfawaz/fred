"""
Model-call routing and tracing helpers for ReAct execution.

Why this module exists:
- LangChain can call the chat model directly, but Fred adds two platform concerns
  around those calls: model routing and tracing
- routing needs small operation labels such as `routing` and `planning`
- tracing needs stable helpers to read model names from models and responses
- keeping that logic here prevents those SDK-specific details from spreading into
  the Fred runtime contract or prompt code

How to use:
- use `infer_react_model_operation_from_messages(...)` before a model call when
  deciding whether the turn is initial routing or tool-driven planning
- the model-call span/KPI instrumentation itself lives in
  `middleware.TracingKpiMiddleware` (re-homed there by #1972)

Example:
- operation inference:
  `operation = infer_react_model_operation_from_messages(messages)`

# Model-operation labels are Fred tracing metadata, not agent-facing concepts.
# Why they exist:
# - routed model factories may choose different model configs for different kinds
#   of ReAct work inside one turn
# - tracing should make that split visible without leaking SDK event shapes
# How to use:
# - `routing` is the safe default for generic assistant turns
# - `planning` marks turns where the assistant is already in a tool-driven loop
# Example:
# - the first assistant response in a turn usually traces as `routing`
# - a follow-up model call after tool execution traces as `planning`
