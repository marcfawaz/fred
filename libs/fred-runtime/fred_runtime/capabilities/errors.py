Named capability errors (#1973, RFC AGENT-CAPABILITY-RFC.md §4).

Why this module exists:
- capability registration is validated at pod boot and must fail startup
  LOUDLY with an error that names exactly which rule broke and for which
  capability — a half-registered capability silently degrading an agent is
  the trust failure the RFC forbids (§3.9)
"""

from __future__ import annotations


class CapabilityError(RuntimeError):
    """Base class for all capability-system errors."""


class CapabilityRegistrationError(CapabilityError):
    """A capability could not be registered or failed boot validation."""


class DuplicateCapabilityIdError(CapabilityRegistrationError):
    """Two installed packages declare the same capability id (RFC §4)."""


class DuplicateChatPartKindError(CapabilityRegistrationError):
    """
    Two chat parts declare the same `kind` discriminator (RFC §4) — the
    `UiPart` union must stay unambiguous.
    """


class MissingRequiredEnvError(CapabilityRegistrationError):
    """A capability's `required_env` variable is absent at pod boot (RFC §7.2)."""


class DefaultOnRequiredSettingsError(CapabilityRegistrationError):
    """
    A capability combines `team_scope=default_on` with a `TeamSettingsModel`
    that has required fields (RFC §8.2) — default-on enablement cannot ask a
    team admin for mandatory settings it never collected.
    """


class InvalidExecutionModelError(CapabilityRegistrationError):
    """
    A capability overrides `middleware()` without implementing `tools()` —
    it has zero Graph-visible runtime contribution — yet its manifest's
    `execution_models` contains `"graph"` (CAPAB-02, RFC §3.2, §3.9). This
    fires in BOTH shapes of the mistake, not just one: the field was never
    explicitly set and kept the class default (`("react", "graph")`), OR it
    was explicitly written out that way on purpose. Either way, such a
    capability would silently contribute zero tools to any Graph agent that
    selects it — the exact trap `execution_models` exists to make
    impossible. Declare `execution_models=("react",)` explicitly, or
    implement `tools()` for the plain-tool portion so the capability is
    genuinely Graph-visible.
    """


class CapabilityTableHygieneError(CapabilityRegistrationError):
    """
    A capability's owned `tables` break the RFC §7.1 hygiene rules — a table
    name not prefixed `cap_<id>_`, or a cross-table foreign key. Capability
    tables are independently versioned pip-package tables: a shared prefix
    keeps their namespace collision-free, and forbidding foreign keys (core
    ids are referenced as plain columns instead) keeps install/uninstall
    ordering free. Raised at pod boot so the violation surfaces at deploy.
    """


class UnknownCapabilityError(CapabilityError):
    """An agent references a capability this pod does not have installed (RFC §3.8)."""


class AssetSlotViolationError(CapabilityError):
    """
    An upload set violates a declared `AssetSlot`'s cardinality or accepted
    types (RFC §3.4). Raised by platform code BEFORE any capability code runs;
    callers map it to a generic, uniformly-worded HTTP 422 (#1974).
    """


class CapabilityConfigInvalidError(CapabilityError):
    """
    A persisted `capability_config` slice no longer validates against the
    capability's `StoredConfigModel`, and its lazy `upgrade_config` hook could
    not migrate it (RFC §3.9) — the `capability_config_invalid` suspension
    reason. Never a silent degrade (#1974).
    """


class CapabilityAssemblyError(CapabilityError):
    """Selected capabilities could not be assembled into one agent."""


class TurnOptionsInvalidError(CapabilityError):
    """
    A per-turn `turn_options` slice is invalid (#1976, RFC §3.5): its key is a
    capability the instance did not select / the pod does not have, or the slice
    does not validate against that capability's `TurnOptionsModel`. Raised at
    turn start and mapped to a typed HTTP 422 — the same style as
    `validate_config` — before any streaming begins.
