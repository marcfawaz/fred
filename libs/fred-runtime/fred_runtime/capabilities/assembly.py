Agent assembly: selected capabilities → the platform-frame block
(#1973, RFC AGENT-CAPABILITY-RFC.md §3.5, §3.8, §5.3, §5.4).

Why this module exists:
- the platform frame reserves ONE capability slot
  (`build_react_platform_middleware_frame(capability_middleware=...)`) and the
  frame does NOT sort — this module is where the deterministic order is
  produced: capability blocks sorted by capability id (a UI reorder must not
  change behavior), authored order preserved within one capability's stack
- capability `HitlSpec`s never become middleware; they are collected here
  into `CapabilityHitlBinding`s for the single `FredHitlMiddleware` gate
- `capability.tools(ctx)` — the primary, execution-model-agnostic authoring
  surface (fred-sdk `AgentCapability.tools`) — is read once per selected
  capability into one deduped-by-name map: `block.tools` for Graph agents
  (bridge, Phase 4) and HITL-tool resolution below both read that one map

How to use:
- per selected capability, build its typed context with
  `build_capability_context(...)` (raw stored-config / turn-options slices
  are validated against the capability's own models — the RFC §3.5/§3.8
  slice-validation pattern)
- then `build_capability_agent_block(registry, contexts)` and pass
  `block.middleware` / `block.hitl` into the ReAct loop builder; `block.tools`
  is the plain tool objects, execution-model-agnostic

    Assemble the selected capabilities into the frame's capability block.

    Determinism rule (RFC §5.3): iteration is `sorted(capability id)` — never
    selection order, never registration order — and each capability's
    authored middleware list order is preserved within its block.

    `tools()` (not `middleware()`) is the single source of truth for a
    capability's tool objects (RFC §3.2, §5): it is read directly, EXACTLY
    once per selected capability (CAPAB-02), into one deduped-by-name map
    shared by three consumers — the ReAct middleware binding (via
    `ToolCarrierMiddleware`, built directly from these same instances), the
    `HitlSpec.tool` resolution below, and the `tools` field Graph agents
    consume. One call means one set of tool objects: no risk of a
    stateful/non-deterministic `tools()` implementation producing a different
    instance for the ReAct binding than the one `HitlGateRequest.tool`
    exposes to a `when` predicate.

    `tools()` and `middleware()` compose, they are not either/or: a
    `ToolCarrierMiddleware` is added whenever `tools()` returns anything,
    AND, separately, an overridden `middleware()` is always also called (for
    the genuine ReAct-only hook `tools()` cannot express — RFC §3.2's
    "implement `tools()` too; do not fold the tools into the middleware
    override" case). Only the DEFAULT `middleware()` is skipped — calling it
    would just rebuild the same `ToolCarrierMiddleware` from a second,
    redundant `tools(ctx)` call, exactly what the single-call rule above
    prevents. Two DIFFERENT capabilities exposing the same tool name is a
