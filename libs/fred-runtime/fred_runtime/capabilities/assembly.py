Agent assembly: selected capabilities → the platform-frame block
(#1973, RFC AGENT-CAPABILITY-RFC.md §3.5, §3.8, §5.3, §5.4).

Why this module exists:
- the platform frame reserves ONE capability slot
  (`build_react_platform_middleware_frame(capability_middleware=...)`) and the
  frame does NOT sort — this module is where the deterministic order is
  produced: capability blocks sorted by capability id (a UI reorder must not
  change behavior), authored order preserved within one capability's stack
- capability `HitlSpec`s never become middleware; they are collected here
  into `CapabilityHitlBinding`s for the single `FredHitlMiddleware` gate

How to use:
- per selected capability, build its typed context with
  `build_capability_context(...)` (raw stored-config / turn-options slices
  are validated against the capability's own models — the RFC §3.5/§3.8
  slice-validation pattern)
- then `build_capability_agent_block(registry, contexts)` and pass
  `block.middleware` / `block.hitl` into the ReAct loop builder
