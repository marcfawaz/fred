"""
Offline tests for the ``checkpoint_thread_owner`` index (CTRLP-12 A4).

Why this file exists:
- every ``aput`` must write exactly one owner row per thread (upsert, not
  duplicate) and its owner write must be best-effort — a forced failure must
  NEVER raise out of ``aput`` (it cannot fail a user's turn);
- the one-shot backfill must produce one owner row per DISTINCT thread in
  ``session_history``;
- the per-user purge must delete exactly that user's threads and no others.

All tests are offline — a temporary SQLite database, no external services.
