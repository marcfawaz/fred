"""Ppt-filler-local copy of the inline-Markdown subset parser (bold/italic/code spans).

This is the single source of truth for the inline-Markdown SUBSET the PPT filler
understands: ``**bold**``, ``*italic*`` / ``_italic_``, ``***both***`` and
``` `code` ```. It is pure (no pptx import) so the filler
([`traversal.py`](traversal.py)) only owns the thin step of writing the parsed
:class:`Span` list as its own runs.

Parsing is intentionally FLAT (non-recursive): the first matching span wins and any
markers left inside it (e.g. the ``_x_`` in ``**_x_**``) are stripped rather than
re-interpreted. Stray/mismatched markers anywhere in the text are stripped too, so no
literal ``*`` or ``_`` ever leaks into the output. Code spans are the one exception:
markers inside backticks are literal and are preserved untouched.
