"""Shared text-frame traversal for the PPT Filler toolkit.

This is the single seam reused by BOTH directions of the feature:

- **List** (used by the parser, PPTFILL-01): find every ``{{key}}`` occurrence on a
  slide.
- **Replace** (used by the filler, PPTFILL-05): replace every ``{{key}}`` occurrence on
  a slide with a provided value.

Both directions share the same run-merging logic so they can never diverge: any key the
parser surfaces is guaranteed fillable, and vice versa. The round-trip test
(``parse → fill → re-parse``) is the regression guard for that invariant.

PowerPoint frequently splits a single ``{{key}}`` placeholder across several runs inside
one paragraph (e.g. because of autocorrect or spell-check spans). Both directions
therefore merge the run texts of a paragraph, operate on the merged string, and map the
result back onto the runs.

Shape coverage. A placeholder is fillable wherever python-pptx exposes a text frame, so
the traversal walks, recursively:

- plain text boxes, titles, and other placeholders (``has_text_frame`` shapes);
- **table** cells (each cell is a text frame);
- **grouped** shapes — recursing into the group, so a text box / table nested at any
  depth is reached.

Still out of scope (no clean ``text_frame`` API in python-pptx; text lives in low-level
DrawingML XML): **SmartArt** (``DIAGRAM`` / ``IGX_GRAPHIC``) and **chart** text. Keys
placed there are not seen by the parser and therefore not filled; this is documented in
the RFC rather than silently mis-handled.
