"""Chat-time fill tools of the ``ppt_filler`` capability (#1903).

Port of Kea's ``integrations/ppt_filler/toolkit.py`` re-seated on the Swift
capability seams: the agent context becomes a typed
:class:`~fred_sdk.contracts.capability.CapabilityContext`, the KF clients
become typed `RuntimeServices` ports, and the output upload goes through the
workspace filesystem port.

Pipeline (all derived from the instance's persisted stored config, never from
hardcoded slide indices):

1. **Dynamic per-slide ``args_schema``** — built at middleware-construction
   time from the persisted ``schema_slides``. Nested by slide: one
   ``slide_<n>`` object per schema slide, each leaf carrying its note
   description so the model gets inline guidance.
2. **Fill** — fetch the template through ``services.agent_assets`` (the
   per-instance config-asset store), open with python-pptx, and fill each
   provided ``slide_<n>`` group via the SHARED traversal
   (:func:`~fred_capability_ppt_filler.traversal.replace_keys_on_slide`).
   Image keys are placed as pictures via the image-anchor traversal, fetching
   bytes through ``services.document_content``.
3. **Deliver** — write the filled deck to the agent workspace
   (``services.workspace_fs``), best-effort convert to PDF
   (:func:`fred_core.convert_pptx_bytes_to_pdf`) and return either a
   :class:`PptPreviewPart` (preview pane + download) or a plain download
   :class:`LinkPart` fallback.

Shape coverage is defined by the shared traversal, not re-implemented here:
text boxes, table cells, and shapes nested inside groups are all filled.
SmartArt and chart text remain out of scope (no clean ``text_frame`` API in
python-pptx).

    Contributed ``ppt_preview`` chat part (#1903, preview-pane extension).

    Why this exists:
    - after a fill, the deck is shown as a read-only PDF preview in a resizable
      side pane, so the user can glance at the result and ask for a correction
      without downloading anything. The card carries both open-preview and
      .pptx download, so a separate download chip is redundant.

    Durability:
    - both URLs are the DURABLE, bearer-protected KF ``/fs/download/{path}``
      hrefs (never a signed short-TTL link) — this part is persisted in the
      conversation, so a frozen signed URL would 403 when the chat is reopened
      later. The frontend fetches them with the session bearer at open time.

    Freshness (the edit→preview loop):
    - ``version`` is stamped per fill (PDF content hash) and used as the
      react-pdf remount key, so a re-fill under the same storage key still
      yields a fresh fetch and an open pane updates live.
