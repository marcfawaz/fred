"""Parser / validator for the PPT Filler toolkit (PPTFILL-01).

Turns a ``.pptx`` into a per-slide template schema plus a list of structured,
slide-numbered errors. Pure and offline: it reads the deck, lists ``{{keys}}`` via the
shared traversal, parses descriptions from each slide's notes, and validates that the
text-box keys and the described keys match per slide.

The schema/error Pydantic models defined here (:class:`KeyField`, :class:`SlideSchema`,
:class:`TemplateError`, :class:`ParseResult`) are the data contract that downstream
issues (params model, analyze endpoint, fill tool) import.
