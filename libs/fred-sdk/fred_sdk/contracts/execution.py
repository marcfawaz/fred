Runtime execution contract: identity and request models (RUNTIME-07 rev. 2).

Why this module exists:
- Establishes fred-sdk as the single authoritative source of truth for the
  frontend-facing runtime execution contract.
- Every execution is team-scoped and attributable to user_id + team_id +
  agent_instance_id (carried in runtime_context).

Authorization model (RUNTIME-07 rev. 2):
- The control-plane issues NO signed grant or capability. Identity is the
  caller's Keycloak JWT (Authorization: Bearer); authorization is decided at the
  agent pod by an OpenFGA check on the caller's team, per request. The pod
  resolves a managed instance's template + tuning from the control-plane
  team-scoped binding (ReBAC-gated) — config, never a capability.

Architectural boundary (MUST NOT cross):
- Fred code must NOT implement pod discovery, dynamic routing, in-app
  load-balancing, or topology-aware failover. Those concerns belong to:
  Kubernetes Service, Ingress/Gateway, DNS, namespace isolation, and Argo CD.
- Fred code is responsible for: endpoint protection, RBAC/REBAC checks,
  team-scoped managed agent authorization, and runtime execution contracts.

How to use:
- Prefer managed execution: set agent_instance_id (team comes from runtime_context).
- Use agent_id (direct template) only for internal/dev compatibility.
- session_id is the primary continuity key across normal turns and HITL resumes.
- checkpoint_id enables precise resume from a specific graph snapshot.

Example::

    req = RuntimeExecuteRequest(
        input="What is the status of project X?",
        session_id="sess-abc",
        agent_instance_id="inst-42",
        runtime_context=RuntimeContext(user_id="u-1", team_id="t-1"),

# Checkpoint and history access semantics (documentation)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Architectural note (Phase 1 — checkpoint/history access semantics):
#
# fred-runtime is a CONSUMER of persisted checkpoint state, not its ownership
# authority. Control-plane owns the mapping from session to checkpoint storage.
#
# Runtime MUST validate before resuming:
# - the caller is authorized for the session's team (Keycloak JWT + OpenFGA)
# - checkpoint_id (when provided) belongs to the authorized session_id
# - checkpoint_id is in a resumable state
# - if resuming HITL, the checkpoint is in a waiting state compatible with
#   the provided resume_payload
#
# Separation of concerns:
# - checkpoint state  = runtime-facing graph persistence (LangGraph checkpointer)
# - history state     = UI-facing / audit-facing typed interaction history
#
# Persistence infrastructure details (connection strings, credentials, table
# names) MUST remain runtime-environment concerns and must never appear in
# frontend-facing contracts.

# Kubernetes-native platform boundary (documentation)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Fred code MUST NOT implement the following concerns — they are Kubernetes
# platform responsibilities:
# - Pod discovery or dynamic runtime pod listing
# - Service-to-pod resolution (use Kubernetes Service + DNS)
# - Custom in-app load balancing or traffic distribution
# - Topology-aware failover logic
# - Runtime endpoint topology management beyond a single configured URL
#
# Fred code IS responsible for:
# - Endpoint protection (Keycloak RBAC, OpenFGA REBAC)
# - Team-scoped managed agent authorization (pod-side OpenFGA check, no grant)
# - Runtime execution contracts (this module)
# - History and checkpoint access validation
# - Managed execution semantics (agent_instance_id resolution via control-plane)
#
# Routing, exposure, and discovery belong to:
# - Kubernetes Service
# - Ingress / Gateway API
# - Namespace isolation and DNS stable names
# - Argo CD / GitOps deployment descriptors
