Context and capability payloads shared by the v2 runtime surface.

Why this module exists:
- keep portable execution context and typed capability payloads explicit
- give v2 runtimes one Fred-owned contract for tool calls, artifact publication,
  and resource reads
- make the current migration state visible: `portable_context` is the preferred
  long-term contract, while `runtime_context` remains a transitional compatibility
  bridge for existing Fred behavior that has not been ported yet

How to use:
- prefer `PortableContext` when propagating tracing, identity, and small portable
  execution metadata
- prefer explicit request/result models (e.g. `ToolInvocationRequest`) over direct
  service or storage client access
- use `BoundRuntimeContext.runtime_context` only when one existing Fred behavior
  still depends on legacy runtime fields and no narrower v2 capability exists yet

Example:
- `binding.portable_context.session_id`
- `await services.workspace_fs.read_text("shared/templates/template.md")`
