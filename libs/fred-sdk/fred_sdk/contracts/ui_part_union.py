`UiPart` union registration — capability chat parts join the union at
model-build time (#1977, RFC AGENT-CAPABILITY-RFC §3.6/§4).

Why this module exists:
- `UiPart` (`fred_sdk/contracts/context.py`) was a hand-edited hotspot: adding
  a chat part meant editing the union literal plus every place that switches
  on part kinds. Capabilities declare `manifest.chat_parts` instead; this
  module folds those classes into the ONE union so every referencing model
  (runtime events, tool results, OpenAI-compat metadata) and the generated
  OpenAPI pick them up with zero hand edits.

How it works (and why it is this involved):
- pydantic resolves field annotations at class creation, so swapping the
  module-level `UiPart` alias alone changes nothing for already-built models.
  `rebuild_ui_part_union` therefore (1) swaps the alias in every loaded module
  that imported it, (2) rewrites the resolved annotation objects of every
  affected model field, and (3) force-rebuilds affected models leaves-first so
  embedding models (e.g. `FredChatCompletionChunk` → `FredChunkChoice` →
  `FredChunkMetadata`) re-capture the extended nested schemas.

How to use:
- boot / registration (the only intended caller is the capability registry):
  `rebuild_ui_part_union(registry.chat_parts())`
- always pass the FULL extra set: the result is `BASE_UI_PARTS + extra_parts`,
  never cumulative across calls — calling with `()` restores the frozen base
  union (tests rely on this to undo extension)
- validators needing the current union must resolve it lazily:
  `TypeAdapter(current_ui_part_union())` AFTER registration, never a
  module-level adapter built at import time
