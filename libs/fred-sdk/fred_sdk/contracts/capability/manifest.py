Capability manifest — the declaration half of a capability (#1973, RFC §3.1).

Why this module exists:
- one declarative object drives the product contract and the generated UI:
  agent-creation fields, upload slots, contributed chat parts and side panels,
  the capability router, owned tables, required env vars, and team scoping
- the runtime registry (fred-runtime) validates manifests at pod boot and
  fails startup loudly on conflicts (RFC §4)

How to use:
- declare one `CapabilityManifest` as the `manifest` ClassVar of an
  `AgentCapability` subclass; keep `version` bumped per release — it is the
  cache key for computed surfaces (RFC §3.7) and the stored-config schema
  version (RFC §3.9)
