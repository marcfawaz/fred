Core authoring contract for Fred v2 agents.

This module matters because it defines the language an agent author uses to
describe a business role in Fred. The important question is not "how do I wire
LangGraph?" but "what kind of service am I building for a user?"

The v2 contract therefore separates the authoring surface from the execution
engine used later by the runtime. Authors describe the service in Fred terms;
the runtime then delegates execution to the appropriate implementation engine
such as the LangChain/LangGraph ReAct stack or the deep-agent runtime.

The main authoring families are:
- `ReActAgentDefinition` for assistants whose value comes from flexible
  conversation plus tools
- `DeepAgentDefinition` as a specialized ReAct authoring shape when the service
  still behaves like an assistant but needs a deeper planning/execution engine
- `GraphAgentDefinition` for services whose value comes from a clear business
  journey with explicit steps, decisions, and guarded actions

The models in this file are intentionally pure. They describe what the agent
is, what it needs, and what a developer or product owner should be able to
inspect safely before anything is executed.

    """
    One explicit rule your agent should keep following.

    Why this exists:
    - use a guardrail when you want one short rule to stay visible and explicit
      instead of hiding it inside a long system prompt
    - this is useful for rules such as grounding, uncertainty, or language

    How to use it:
    - write one guardrail per important rule
    - `guardrail_id` is a slug you invent — pick a short lowercase name that
      describes the rule, e.g. "grounding", "uncertainty", "scope". It does
      not need to match anything else.
    - keep `title` short (shown in inspection views)
    - write `description` as a direct instruction the model can follow
    - use guardrails for sharp, stable rules — not for tone or persona (those
      belong in the system prompt)

    Important:
    - a guardrail is prompt-level guidance, not a hard technical sandbox

    Example:
    ```python
    GuardrailDefinition(
        guardrail_id="grounding",
        title="Ground claims in corpus evidence",
