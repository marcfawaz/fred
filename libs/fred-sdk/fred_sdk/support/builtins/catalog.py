"""
Exact catalog of native Fred built-in tools for v2 agents.

Why this module exists:
- an agent author can read one file to see which native Fred tools are already
  available when creating a new profile, ReAct agent, or Deep agent
- a Fred core developer can extend the native built-in catalog in one explicit
  place instead of scattering tool metadata across the runtime
- built-in tools are different from Python-authored tools and MCP/runtime tools
  because Fred ships them directly
- the runtime resolver needs one place to read the input schema and execution
  backend for each built-in tool

Exact built-in list today:
- `knowledge.search`: Fred's native RAG retrieval tool. It searches the current
  libraries, corpus, and session attachments and returns grounded snippets.
- `traces.summarize_conversation`: observability tool that summarizes the recent
  execution trace of one Fred conversation.
- `geo.render_points`: UI helper that turns latitude/longitude points into a map
  payload Fred can render.
- `artifacts.publish_text`: output helper that creates a downloadable text
  artifact for the user.
- `resources.fetch_text`: configuration/support helper that loads a Fred-managed
  text resource by key and scope.

How to use it:
- agent author:
  import the `TOOL_REF_*` constants when a new agent definition should depend on
  one native Fred tool
- Fred core developer:
  update this catalog when adding a new native built-in tool to Fred itself
- runtime code:
  call `get_builtin_tool_spec(...)` when it needs the schema or backend for one
  built-in tool
- review/debug code:
  call `list_builtin_tool_specs()` when it needs the full native catalog

Example:
- agent author:
  `declared_tool_refs=(ToolRefRequirement(tool_ref=TOOL_REF_KNOWLEDGE_SEARCH),)`
- runtime:
  `spec = get_builtin_tool_spec(TOOL_REF_KNOWLEDGE_SEARCH)`
- review/debug:
  `all_specs = list_builtin_tool_specs()`

    Metadata describing one built-in Fred tool.

    Why this exists:
    - built-in tools need one compact declaration that pairs the stable tool ref
      with its input schema and runtime backend
    - the runtime resolver should read this data, not rebuild it

    Exact tools described by this catalog today:
    - `knowledge.search`: native Fred retrieval / RAG tool

    - `geo.render_points`: map-rendering helper
    - `artifacts.publish_text`: text artifact publishing helper
    - `resources.fetch_text`: Fred-managed text resource reader

    How to use it:
    - authors normally reference the `TOOL_REF_*` constants
    - runtime code reads `BuiltinToolSpec` when it needs the input schema,
