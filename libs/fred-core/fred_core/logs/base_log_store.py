Base Log Store Abstraction
==========================

This module defines the *storage contract* for Fred’s application logs.

Why this exists in Fred:
- We want **one emission API** (logging handler / writer) that can plug into
  **many backends** (OpenSearch, in-memory ring for dev, CSV for tests, etc.).
- Backends differ in capabilities and SLOs; we keep the interface minimal but
  sufficient: readiness, single-event ingest, and bulk ingest. Reading these
  logs back is done directly against the backing store (OpenSearch Dashboards),
  not through Fred — this module is write-path only.

Key ideas:
- `BaseLogStore` is a `Protocol` (static duck-typing) → implementations don’t
  need inheritance, only matching shape.
- Dev default can be an in-memory ring (fast, zero-ops); prod can be OpenSearch.

class BaseLogStore(Protocol):
    """Abstract Log store API used by the logging pipeline.

    Architectural role:
    - Decouple **log emission** from **physical storage**.
    - Keep the contract intentionally small so backends remain easy to implement.
    - Allow services to boot even if the store is slow to initialize
      (callers may handle failures without crashing business logic).

    Implementation notes:
    - `index_event` must be non-blocking or bounded in latency (hot paths).
    - `bulk_index` is for throughput (batching) when the caller can coalesce.
    """

    def ensure_ready(self) -> None:
        """Ensure the backing store is initialized (indices/tables exist, mappings applied).

        Why:
        - We prefer to *self-provision* indices/mappings on first run to reduce ops toil.
        - Called once at startup; failures should be handled upstream as non-fatal when possible.

        Contract:
        - Must not block request handling; drop/buffer on outage rather than crash.
        - Idempotency is best-effort (logs are observability, not correctness).

        Why:
        - Backends like OpenSearch benefit from bulk ingestion.
        - Caller decides batching cadence; store optimizes the write path.
