"""Registry boot invariants for the writable_document capability (RFC §4, §7.1).

Registering the capability into a fresh `CapabilityRegistry` and calling
`.validate()` must be green: the owned table is prefixed `cap_writable_document_`
with no foreign keys, and the `writable_document` chat-part kind is unique.
