"""`WritableDocumentCapability` — the writable_document feature as ONE capability (#1905).

Why this module exists:
- Kea shipped "Writable Documents" scattered across an in-process tool factory, a
  chat-part hydrated out of tool JSON (`fred_parts`), a bespoke controller, a
  Postgres store wired into `ApplicationContext`, and — crucially — orchestrator
  bookkeeping that diffed each session's last-activity time to decide when to tell
  the agent the user had edited a document. On Swift the WHOLE feature is this one
  `AgentCapability` (RFC AGENT-CAPABILITY-RFC.md §3): the manifest (contributed
  `writable_document` chat part, editor side panel, list/get/put/export router, one
  owned table) plus the chat-time middleware (the `write_document` tool, the
  user-edit notification, and the open-documents catalog prompt).

The three middleware hooks map one-to-one onto the Kea orchestrator seams they
replace:
- the `write_document` tool ports Kea's in-process tool verbatim (full-content
  replace, de-dup by exact title within the session, reuse `document_id` to revise
  in place) — but identity flows through the closure, never the tool schema (RFC §3.5).
- `abefore_model` replaces the orchestrator's `_collect_user_edited_documents`
  last-activity diff with a durable per-row flag (`agent_notified_at`): a user edit
  clears it (router PUT), and this hook injects the SAME system note Kea injected,
  then stamps the flag so the note fires exactly once.
- `awrap_model_call` replaces the orchestrator's model-only "documents already open"
  reminder, overlaying the SAME catalog text on the system prompt per model call
  (the `_McpInstructionsMiddleware` delivery path) so it survives across turns
  without being persisted.
