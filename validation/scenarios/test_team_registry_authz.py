Swift team-registry governance validation (AUTHZ-05 review item 9).

Teams are no longer Keycloak groups - a team is a `team_metadata` row plus its
OpenFGA relations, and its existence is governed by three platform-admin-only,
registry-scoped capabilities that grant nothing about a team's own content:
`can_create_team` (`POST /teams`, one-shot bootstrap with an explicit initial
admin), `can_list_all_teams` (`GET /teams/all`, bypasses the caller's own
CAN_READ visibility filter), `can_delete_team` (`DELETE /teams/{id}`), and
`can_rescue_team_admin` (`POST /teams/{id}/rescue-admin`, only succeeds when
the team currently has zero team_admin).

What this file does NOT attempt: driving a team to a genuine zero-admin state
through the public API. `remove_team_member` (full member removal) and
`revoke_team_member_role` (AUTHZ-06 granular single-role revoke, the only
mutation left on `/teams/{team_id}/members/{user_id}` - there is no bulk
PATCH) both enforce `_ensure_team_keeps_at_least_one_admin` symmetrically
(self-revoke included), so there is no documented, self-service path to an
orphaned team - rescue-admin is a break-glass tool for an out-of-band state
(e.g. data migration), not a flow this black-box suite can legitimately
construct. What IS tested instead: that guard itself (a team_admin cannot
revoke their own team_admin role out of existence), and that rescue-admin is
refused - loudly, with no side effect - against any team that still has an
admin.
