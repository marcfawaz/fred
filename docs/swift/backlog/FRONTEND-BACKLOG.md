# Frontend Adaptation Backlog

This backlog tracks the remaining frontend migration work for Swift.

It is intentionally compact. Historical phase detail that is already closed has
been collapsed into status summaries; use git history and the referenced RFCs for
implementation archaeology.

## 0 Current Target

The frontend target is now:

- pre-auth static bootstrap reads only `/config.json` for `frontend_basename`
- auth mode is loaded from `GET /control-plane/v1/frontend/config` (FRONT-08)
- application bootstrap comes from `GET /control-plane/v1/frontend/bootstrap`
- shell-critical state comes from control-plane, not `agentic-backend`
- domain pages call their owning domain APIs after bootstrap:
  - control-plane for teams, managed agents, execution preparation, sessions
  - knowledge-flow for documents, resources, libraries, files
  - runtime for execution and runtime history via prepared URLs
- `apps/frontend/src/rework` is the target UI surface
- new rework code uses atoms/molecules/organisms, CSS modules/design tokens, and
  no MUI imports

The default development loop for frontend work is:

- `control-plane-backend`
- `knowledge-flow-backend`
- `frontend`
- optionally one reachable runtime pod for runtime-backed features

The frontend shell must still boot when no runtime pod is available.

## 1 Completed Convergence Baseline

These items are kept only as a compact record. Do not add new work under this
section; create or update the active task sections below instead.

| ID | Status | Result | Residual work |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FRONT-01 | Done | Bootstrap converged around `/config.json` + control-plane bootstrap. Shell no longer needs legacy agentic config/permissions. | Typed bootstrap recovery screen remains minor/deferred. |
| FRONT-02 | Substantially done | No-security personal-team baseline works as the intended developer mode. | Two smoke checks remain useful: active team after hard refresh and navigation with one available team. |
| Backend readiness gates | Partial | Personal-team and bootstrap ownership are mostly converged in control-plane. | Bootstrap permission coverage, reserved/system-team documentation, and one no-security bootstrap regression test remain useful hardening. |
| FRONT-03 | Done | Managed agent pages use control-plane templates/instances and `agent_instance_id`. | Better unavailable-runtime messaging for enrolled instances remains polish. |
| FRONT-04 | Done | Managed session metadata belongs to control-plane; runtime owns message history. Sidebar reads control-plane sessions; chat history reads runtime prepared URLs. | Metadata freshness/reorder path remains optional. |

Frozen frontend invariants:

- no boot-time dependency on `/agentic/*`
- no frontend runtime-topology resolution
- no raw `agent_id` execution path in managed chat
- `session_id` is the frontend/runtime/control-plane conversation identity
- control-plane session metadata does not serve full runtime message history

## 2 Live Frontend Work

| ID | Owner | Status | Backlog section | Execution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FRONT-05 | Dimitri | In progress (rework 20→15) | §7 | issue #1840 |
| FRONT-08 | Simon | Done — merged (PR #1750, 2026-06-16) | §14 | GitHub issue #1748 (closed) |
| FRONT-09 | Dimitri | RFC proposed | §15 | TBD |
| FRONT-13 | Dimitri | In progress — native PDF rendering landed 2026-07-19, AI panel not started | §19 | branch `2004-capab-01-agent-template-capability-gating-gaps` |

Recommended order:

1. Keep FRONT-05 narrow: remove remaining `agenticOpenApi` usage without reviving
   deprecated surfaces.
2. Start FRONT-09 with a v2 route and backend browse hardening; keep old
   resource/library pages until parity.
3. FRONT-13 depends on FRONT-09.C/D (already landed) for the corpus-side entry point;
   no hard ordering constraint otherwise.

**Opportunistic legacy cleanup (Dimitri, ongoing — no FRONT-ID, not RFC-backed):**
Chipping away at `src/components`/`src/pages` dead code and legacy retirement in
small verified commits, separate from FRONT-05/FRONT-09. Landed 2026-07-19 on
`2004-capab-01-agent-template-capability-gating-gaps`: dead `monitoringApi` slice
+ 6 unused npm deps removed; `Protected` + `ConfirmationDialogProvider` moved into
rework (closed the only legacy→rework reverse-coupling); `PageError`/
`PageUnauthorized` ported off MUI; `LibraryTreePlayground` relocated (already
MUI-free, pure move). Still legacy, each needs its own session, not a quick
relocation: `TaskPlayground` (no rework Select/Slider atom yet), `ComingSoon`
(squashing into `PageEmptyState` would drop the branded per-site icon),
`LoadingWithProgress` (rework's `ProgressBar` atom has no indeterminate mode),
and the monitoring/`tools` pages (`Kpis`, `Runtime`, `DataHub`, `RebacBackfill`,
`ProcessorBench`, `ProcessorRunDetail`, `McpHub`) — real pages with their own
legacy UI kit, not pure relocations. Full tree still not reachable regardless:
also blocked on the missing evaluation UI (#1892) and the disabled PDF viewer
(FRONT-13).

## 3 Explicit Non-Goals

Do not spend migration time on:

- restoring every legacy team collaboration flow before the rework shell is clean
- perfecting security-enabled UX before no-security mode remains stable
- preserving legacy agent authoring behavior outside the control-plane managed
  instance model
- fixing old resource/library pages cosmetically when FRONT-09 is replacing them
- duplicating prompt/resource functionality across multiple pages without a
  product decision

## 7 Phase FRONT-05 — Agentic-Backend Removal From Frontend

**ID:** FRONT-05  **Owner:** Dimitri  **Status:** In progress (rework 20→15)
**Execution:** GitHub issue [#1840](https://github.com/ThalesGroup/fred/issues/1840) (remaining work); partial landed under #1838

Goal: remove all frontend imports from the legacy agentic generated API slices:

- `agenticOpenApi.ts`
- `agenticInspectionApi.ts`
- `agenticSourceApi.ts`

Context:

- `agentic-backend` has been removed from the active monorepo.
- The new managed/rework path should use `runtimeOpenApi.ts`,
  `controlPlaneOpenApi.ts`, or knowledge-flow APIs depending on ownership.
- Legacy chat components and routes were already deleted on 2026-05-21.

Remaining rework imports (15 files as of 2026-06-26), grouped by migration cost.
The 2026-06-26 audit pass split these by whether the runtime type is structurally
identical or genuinely divergent — see the per-type breakdown:

- [ ] **`Channel`** → swap to `runtimeOpenApi`. Runtime is a strict superset
      (adds `hitl_request`, `hitl_response`). Frontend-only; watch for now-
      non-exhaustive `switch` handling. No backend change.
- [ ] **`ChatMessage`** → swap to `runtimeOpenApi`. Runtime equivalent exists and
      is richer (`ui_parts`, hitl parts, `finish_reason`; `ChatMetadata` differs).
      Frontend adaptation only (how parts/metadata are read). No backend change.
      `LinkPart` / `ToolCallPart` / `ToolResultPart` are structurally identical to
      runtime and ride along in the same (mixed) import files.
- [ ] **`AwaitingHumanEvent`** → adapt HITL UI (`HitlPrompt`, `ConversationThread`)
      to the runtime model `AwaitingHumanRuntimeEvent { kind, request:
      HumanInputRequest, sequence }` (vs agentic `{ type, session_id, exchange_id,
      payload }`). Frontend-only — `useChatSse` already consumes the runtime event
      on the streaming path. No backend change.
- [ ] **`FinishReason`** → **needs a decision (possible backend change).** Agentic
      exports a named enum (`"stop" | "length" | "content_filter" | "tool_calls" |
      "cancelled" | "other"`); runtime only has a loose `finish_reason?: string |
      null` field, no named type. Either (a) the frontend owns this union as a local
      view-model type, or (b) the runtime OpenAPI emits a named `FinishReason` enum
      (small backend schema change + regen). Write a short RFC/design note before
      implementing — this is the only item in FRONT-05 that may touch the backend.
- [ ] Migrate remaining shared hooks (`useAgentSelector.ts`, `common/agent.ts`)
      or delete them if no active route uses them.
- [ ] Delete `agenticOpenApi.ts` once all imports are cleared.
- [ ] Delete `agenticInspectionApi.ts` and `agenticSourceApi.ts` once consumers
      are removed.

Already completed:

- [x] **2026-06-26:** repointed the 5 rework files importing only structurally
      identical types (`VectorSearchHit` ×4, `LinkPart` ×1) from `agenticOpenApi`
      to `runtimeOpenApi` — `tsc` green, zero behavior change. Rework imports
      20 → 15. (`SourcesPanel`/`SourceCard`/`SourceDetailModal`, `documentViewerUtils`,
      `ArtifactLinks`.)
- [x] Deleted legacy `pages/Chat.tsx`.
- [x] Deleted `components/chatbot/`.
- [x] Deleted `hooks/useChatSocket.ts` and `hooks/useGroupMessages.ts`.
- [x] Deleted legacy `features/libraries/ChatDocument*`.
- [x] Migrated `hooks/useChatSse.ts` to `rework/core/hooks/useChatSse.ts`.
- [x] Migrated `UserInputSearchPolicy` to the rework `SearchPolicySelect`.

Acceptance:

- [ ] `rg "agenticOpenApi|agenticInspectionApi|agenticSourceApi" apps/frontend/src`
      returns no active imports.
- [ ] frontend code-quality passes.
- [ ] no removed legacy surface is reintroduced to satisfy type imports.

## 13 Phase FRONT-07 — Rework UI Architecture Compliance

**ID:** FRONT-07  **Owner:** Dimitri  **Closed:** 2026-06-02
**Execution:** GitHub issue #1668 / branch `1668-rework-frontend-ui-architecture-compliance`

Closed summary:

- [x] Added shared `SearchField`, `FilterChips`, and `TagInput` molecules.
- [x] Migrated `PromptsPage` to the new molecules.
- [x] Migrated `TuningFieldRenderer` enum/array controls to design-system
      molecules.
- [x] Added missing `--outline-variant` semantic color token.
- [x] Updated `COMPONENT-UX.md`.
- [x] Validated with frontend `make code-quality`.

Do not reopen FRONT-07 for new design-system work. Create a new FRONT or UX item
if a future migration slice needs additional primitives.

## 14 Phase FRONT-08 — Backend-Driven Frontend Auth Config

**ID:** FRONT-08  **Owner:** Simon  **Status:** Done — merged (PR #1750, 2026-06-16)
**RFC:** `docs/swift/rfc/FRONTEND-AUTH-CONFIG-ENDPOINT-RFC.md`
**Execution:** GitHub issue #1748 (closed)

Goal: move the frontend "is user security enabled?" decision out of
`apps/frontend/public/config.json` and onto a public control-plane endpoint.

Target contract:

- `/config.json` keeps only `frontend_basename`
- `GET /control-plane/v1/frontend/config` returns `user_auth`
- `security.user` in backend configuration is the source of truth
- the endpoint is public/unauthenticated because it is needed before deciding
  whether to initialize Keycloak

Implementation checklist:

- [x] Add `FrontendUserAuthConfig` and `FrontendConfig` schemas.
- [x] Add public `GET /control-plane/v1/frontend/config`.
- [x] Update frontend `loadConfig()` to fetch `user_auth` from control-plane.
- [x] Remove `user_auth` from `apps/frontend/public/config.json`.
- [x] Remove `user_auth` from Helm frontend `config_json`.
- [x] Regenerate control-plane OpenAPI types.
- [x] Document the public pre-auth surface in
      `CONTROL-PLANE-PRODUCT-CONTRACT.md §3.1`.
- [x] Validate `make code-quality` and `make test` in control-plane and
      frontend.

Remaining: none — merged via PR #1750.

## 15 Phase FRONT-09 — Rework Knowledge Workspace

**ID:** FRONT-09  **Owner:** Dimitri  **Status:** In progress — A/C/D landed 2026-06-18
**RFC:** `docs/swift/rfc/KNOWLEDGE-WORKSPACE-REWORK-RFC.md`
**Execution:** branch `1772-...-kf-similarity-search` (TeamResourcesPage)

Build a rework-native replacement for the old KnowledgeHub/resource/library
pages. This is a product and performance migration, not a cosmetic rewrite.

> **Landed 2026-06-18 (A/C/D).** Official page `TeamResourcesPage` at
> `/team/:teamId/resources` (decision: own the canonical route directly instead
> of a `resources-v2` shadow; old hub kept reachable at `/knowledge`).
> Documents-only (chat contexts now live under Prompts; the user-assets
> filesystem is not surfaced here yet). Folder tree
> (`FolderRow`) + server-paginated list (`DocRow`/`DocStatusBadge`,
> `deriveDocStatus` unit-tested) on `/documents/metadata/browse`, with upload
> drawer, new-folder drawer, download, preview, delete, toggle-searchable, and
> reprocess wired. **Deferred:** search/sort + tree-summary counts + `next_offset`
> (need FRONT-09.B backend); document **rename** (no backend endpoint); detail
> drawer (FRONT-09.E). **Needs live verification:** upload + reprocess paths
> against a running knowledge-flow backend.

### Scope

- [ ] Add a temporary v2 route, for example `/team/:teamId/resources-v2`, that can
      be tested next to the old `/team/:teamId/resources` page.
- [ ] Implement `apps/frontend/src/rework/components/pages/KnowledgeWorkspacePage/`.
- [ ] Keep the first production slice focused on documents/files.
- [ ] Reuse the existing rework upload drawer/task pattern.
- [ ] Keep old pages available until read-only browse, upload, delete, task
      refresh, empty/error states, and pagination reach parity.

### Backend And Performance Contract

- [ ] Never fetch every file/resource to render the main workspace.
- [ ] Do not use `limit=10000` or broad client-side filtering in the v2 page.
- [ ] Add or harden paginated document browse with `offset`, `limit`, `query`,
      `sort`, and filters; default page size 50, max 200.
- [ ] Add or harden a lightweight library/tree contract that returns nodes and
      counts, not every child item ID.
- [ ] Add paginated resource browse before migrating chat contexts, templates, or
      other resource kinds into the workspace.
- [ ] Ensure Postgres paths sort/filter before pagination and return `total` or
      `next_offset`.

### Workplan

#### FRONT-09.A — Route And Shell

- [x] Register the route and entry point. _(Owns `/team/:teamId/resources` directly, not a v2 shadow.)_
- [x] Create the workspace page with header, tab selector, and document list.
      _(Named `TeamResourcesPage`; detail-drawer slot deferred to FRONT-09.E.)_
- [ ] Add route-state helpers for folder, query, filters, sort, page, and
      selected document. _(Only the tab `?view=` is in the URL today; folder/page is local state.)_
- [x] Add typed loading, empty, and error states. _(Permission-denied minimal.)_

#### FRONT-09.B — Backend Browse Hardening

- [ ] Choose one canonical document browse endpoint for the v2 page.
- [ ] Add backend tests proving pagination is applied in the store/query layer
      for the Postgres path.
- [ ] Add tests for page-size clamping, stable sort, empty page, query filter, and
      permission-scoped results.
- [ ] Update generated frontend API types after the contract is stable.

#### FRONT-09.C — Read-only Document Workspace

- [x] Add hooks for library tree loading and paged document browsing.
      _(`buildTree` + `useListAllTags` + `useBrowseDocumentsByTag`.)_
- [x] Add design-system atoms/molecules for file type, status, rows, and
      pagination. _(`DocStatusBadge`, `DocRow`, `FolderRow`, `ResourcePagination`; breadcrumb/storage deferred.)_
- [x] Render only the current page; do not preload all folders or rows.
- [x] Cache pages by folder/tag. _(By tag id; query/sort caching N/A until FRONT-09.B.)_
- [ ] Ignore or abort stale responses when users switch folders/search quickly.

#### FRONT-09.D — Mutations And Task Refresh

- [x] Wire upload through the existing rework drawer/task pattern. _(`DocumentUploadDrawer`.)_
- [x] Refresh the active folder/page after upload, delete, or reprocess. _(Move/rename deferred.)_
- [ ] Preserve selection and scroll position when safe.
- [x] Surface task progress without polling the whole library tree.
      _(`DocRow` reads `selectActiveTaskForTarget`.)_
- [x] Refresh a document's metadata when its ingestion task **completes**, so the
      badge moves off the pre-processing stages instead of falling back to
      "raw"/"Brut" until a manual reload.
      _(`pagesToRefreshOnTaskCompletion` + effect in `DocumentWorkspace`; unit-tested.)_

#### FRONT-09.E — Detail Drawer And UX Polish

- [ ] Add a document detail drawer with metadata, tags/folder, processing status,
      source/download/open actions, and destructive actions. Native PDF rendering and
      an assistant side panel for the "open"/preview action are tracked separately as
      `FRONT-13` (§19) — do not duplicate that scope here, wire the drawer's preview
      action to the shared `DocumentViewer` component once it lands.
- [ ] Verify keyboard navigation for rows, drawer close, pagination, search, and
      primary actions.
- [ ] Check responsive behavior for mobile and desktop.
- [ ] Validate empty library, hundreds of files, upload in progress, failed
      processing, and permission-denied scenarios.

#### FRONT-09.F — Resource Kinds And Legacy Retirement

- [ ] Migrate chat contexts/templates/resources only after a paginated resource
      browse endpoint exists.
- [ ] Switch sidebar/navigation from old page to v2 after parity.
- [ ] Keep `/resources-legacy` or equivalent fallback for one short validation
      window.
- [ ] Remove old MUI resource/library components once v2 is default and tested.

### Acceptance

- [ ] Users with hundreds of files can browse, search, upload, and inspect files
      without loading all documents/resources into the browser.
- [ ] The v2 page uses rework atoms/molecules/organisms and imports no MUI.
- [ ] Backend tests cover pagination, sort, filters, page-size limits, and
      permission-scoped results.
- [ ] Frontend tests cover route state, loading/empty/error states, pagination,
      and mutation refresh behavior.
- [ ] Old resource/library pages remain untouched until the v2 page reaches
      functional parity.

## 16 Phase FRONT-10 — Fix CGU/GCU Pre-Auth Chicken-and-Egg

**ID:** FRONT-10  **Owner:** Dimitri  **Status:** Done (folded into the dev release)
**Parent:** FRONT-08
**RFC:** `docs/swift/rfc/FRONTEND-AUTH-CONFIG-ENDPOINT-RFC.md §7`
**Execution:** branch `1793-unified-virtual-filesystem`

Problem: `GcuGuard` read the active `gcuVersion` from the authenticated
`/frontend/bootstrap`, but that endpoint 403s (`user_not_accept_gcu`) until the
user has *already* accepted — so the version needed to render the acceptance page
was never delivered before acceptance. On swift this skipped the CGU screen
(`!gcuVersion` short-circuit) and surfaced "Control plane non accessible" on
bootstrap-backed pages.

Fix: extend the FRONT-08 public pre-auth surface — `FrontendConfig` carries the
**effective** `gcu_version` (null when gating is off), and the frontend reads it
at Stage 0 instead of from the bootstrap. See `TERMS_OF_USE.md` and the RFC §7.3
for the full contract.

Checklist:

- [x] Add `gcu_version` to `FrontendConfig`; `build_frontend_config` reports the
      effective value (`null` when `security.user.enabled` false or no version).
- [x] Backend tests assert the public config carries / omits `gcu_version`.
- [x] Frontend `config.tsx` reads `gcu_version` from `/frontend/config`
      (`getGcuVersion()`).
- [x] `useFrontendProperties` sources `gcuVersion` from the public config, not
      the bootstrap.
- [x] `GcuGuard` skips the user-details query when `gcuVersion` is null.
- [x] Regenerate control-plane OpenAPI types.
- [x] Document the contract in `CONTROL-PLANE-PRODUCT-CONTRACT.md §3.1.1`,
      `TERMS_OF_USE.md`, and RFC §7.
- [x] `make code-quality` green in control-plane and frontend.

## 17 Phase FRONT-11 — Branding Property Wiring (contactSupportLink + cleanup)

**ID:** FRONT-11  **Owner:** Simon  **Status:** In progress
**Execution:** GitHub #1829 / branch `1829-front-11-wire-branding-properties`
**RFC:** exempt — wiring already-declared `frontend_settings` config fields to
existing UI; no contract/API change (CLAUDE.md mechanical-fix exemption).

Context: PRISM branding audit on swift. Branding is intentionally config-driven
from the frontend's static `config.json` `properties` surface (favicon,
loading-screen logo via `logoName`, sidebar `siteTitle`/`siteSubtitle`, banners,
avatars, labels, support link). Auth/CGU and product/team bootstrap state remain
control-plane-owned.

Checklist:

- [x] `contactSupportLink` added to `useFrontendProperties` and rendered as a
      "Contact support" item in `UserProfile` (opens in a new tab; shown only when
      the property is non-empty). It was declared in config but rendered nowhere on
      main or the PRISM fork.
- [x] Browser tab name: confirmed already config-driven via `siteDisplayName`
      (`document.title`) — kept as-is; only the redundant local `displayName` alias
      in App.tsx removed (`siteDisplayName` already defaults to "Fred").
- [x] Kept all three brand-text props — `siteDisplayName` (app name: tab, coming-soon,
      loading alt) vs `siteTitle` + `siteSubtitle` (header lockup: sidebar, emails,
      GDPR); distinct roles, all used.
- [x] Dropped `logoHeight` / `logoWidth` — no consumer and no header/wordmark logo
      to size in swift (the logo only appears on the loading screen).
- [x] `showAgent*` family confirmed to have no swift consumer — nothing to remove.
- [x] i18n key `rework.profileMenu.contactSupport` (en/fr).
- [x] `config.json`: central source for static branding `properties`
      (`logoName`, `faviconName`, `site*`, agent nicknames, support link,
      default team/personal banner/avatar assets). Removed the mock branding
      block from `configuration_prod.yaml` so deployments do not carry two
      competing sources of truth.
- [x] Removed control-plane bootstrap `ui_settings` as a parallel branding
      source. `FrontendBootstrap` keeps product/team/authenticated state only;
      `config.json.properties` owns brand display labels.
- [x] `make code-quality` green on frontend.

## 18 Phase FRONT-12 — Generate the TaskEvent union (remove hand-maintained adapter)

`apps/frontend/src/rework/features/tasks/taskTypes.ts` hand-mirrors the canonical
Pydantic task-event models (`libs/fred-core/fred_core/tasks/models.py`), against the
RFC's "all types come from generated OpenAPI" rule
(`docs/swift/rfc/TASK-EVENT-STREAM-RFC.md`). It is a documented temporary adapter
(CTRLP-12) because task events are SSE payloads typed `any` in the generated clients,
so there is nothing to generate from yet.

- [ ] Expose `TaskEvent` (the discriminated union) as an OpenAPI schema component
      from the backend (e.g. a dedicated response/example model), so the generator emits it.
- [ ] Generate the TS union and delete the hand-written interfaces in `taskTypes.ts`;
      keep `AnyTaskEvent`, `taskEventsBasePath`, and `taskKinds` in sync via the generated kinds.
- [ ] Decide whether `TaskLogEvent` is surfaced in the UI; if not, keep it excluded explicitly.

## 19 Phase FRONT-13 — Unified Document Viewer With AI Assistant Panel

**ID:** FRONT-13  **Owner:** Dimitri  **Status:** In progress — PDF wiring done, AI panel not started
**RFC:** `docs/swift/rfc/DOCUMENT-VIEWER-AI-PANEL-RFC.md`
**Depends on:** CHAT-08 (`/documents/:uid` route), FRONT-09.C/D (corpus preview drawer)

Consolidate the two independent document-viewing flows (chat-citation
`DocumentViewerPage` and the corpus workspace preview drawer) into one shared
`DocumentViewer` component, restore native PDF rendering (the code already exists —
`PdfStreamingDocumentViewer`/`usePdfDocumentViewer`/`commands.previewPdf` — but is
unwired from both current entry points), and add a collapsible "ask the assistant"
side panel that scopes a managed-chat turn to the open document via the existing
`selected_document_uids` mechanism. Full rationale and alternatives: see the RFC.

Checklist:

- [x] Introduce a shared `DocumentViewer` component with two render strategies:
      native (`PdfStreamingDocumentViewer`) for `.pdf`, markdown (existing
      `GET /knowledge-flow/v1/markdown/{uid}` path) for every other format.
- [x] Replace `DocumentViewerPage`'s direct `MarkdownRenderer` usage with
      `DocumentViewer`.
- [x] Replace the corpus workspace preview drawer's `MarkdownDocumentViewer` usage
      with `DocumentViewer`; wire `commands.previewPdf` (currently dead code) through
      it instead of leaving it uncalled. Landed as one merged `preview` command
      instead of two — see commit `3ab41d97`.
- [ ] Add the assistant side panel: quick actions ("Summarize", "List key points")
      plus free-text follow-up, opening a managed-chat turn with
      `selected_document_uids: [uid]` — no new backend endpoint.
      **Blocked on a product decision, not a technical unknown:** `ManagedChatPage`
      requires an `agentInstanceId` in its route and `selected_document_uids` only
      exists inside an already-open chat's composer state — there is no "default/
      last-used agent" concept anywhere in the code today. The panel needs an
      agent picker (team's agent instances, same source as `TeamAgentsPage`)
      before it can open a scoped turn. Deferred 2026-07-19, not scheduled for
      swift-golive (the PDF regression was the Must-have item on #1956, not this).
- [x] Update `COMPONENT-UX.md` with the new `DocumentViewer` component and its states.
- [x] Update GitHub issue #1956's "PDF viewer parity" checklist item to point here.

## 20 Progress Snapshot

| Area | Status | Next useful action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bootstrap/auth | Mostly converged | Merge/review FRONT-08. |
| CGU/Terms gating | FRONT-10 fixed | Pre-auth `gcu_version` on `/frontend/config`; verify acceptance flow end-to-end on a CGU-enabled deployment. |
| Agentic frontend removal | In progress (rework 20→15) | FRONT-05: migrate `ChatMessage`/`Channel`/`AwaitingHumanEvent` (frontend-only); decide `FinishReason` (frontend union vs runtime enum — possible backend change, RFC first). |
| Rework design-system migration | FRONT-07 closed | Add new primitives only inside specific feature slices. |
| Knowledge/resource pages | RFC proposed | Start FRONT-09 with backend browse hardening and a temporary v2 route. |
