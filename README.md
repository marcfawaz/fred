Fred is a production-ready platform for building and operating multi-agent AI applications. It has two complementary faces:

- **A hosted platform** — control plane, knowledge flow, chat frontend, auth, team access control, observability, and Kubernetes-ready deployment, all integrated and ready to use.
- **An open agent model** — a typed SDK and lightweight runtime that let teams ship independent agent pods, registered with the platform and operated alongside it without forking the core.

## How Fred is structured

Fred is built around three platform applications and a publishable SDK stack:

| Layer      | Package                                                     | Role                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Platform   | `apps/control-plane-backend`                                | Teams, sessions, agent enrollment, product APIs, `ExecutionGrant` issuance            |
| Platform   | `apps/knowledge-flow-backend`                               | Document ingestion, vectorization, retrieval                                          |
| Platform   | `frontend`                                                  | React chat UI (SSE streaming, rich markdown, math, Mermaid) and agent management UI   |
| Agent pods | `apps/fred-agents`                                          | First-party agent pod — the reference implementation and production execution surface |
| Agent pods | [fred-samples](https://github.com/ThalesGroup/fred-samples) | Example third-party pods — ship your own agents independently                         |
| Libraries  | `libs/fred-sdk`                                             | Agent authoring SDK — ReAct and graph agents, tools, HITL, execution contracts        |
| Libraries  | `libs/fred-runtime`                                         | Pod factory — FastAPI, SSE streaming, checkpointing, CLI (`fred-agents-cli`)          |
| Libraries  | `libs/fred-core`                                            | Shared infrastructure — SQL, KPI, security, config                                    |

**New to the codebase?** Open [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.html`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.html) in your browser for a guided architecture walkthrough — mental models, a 20-minute reading path, and the design decisions that explain everything else. _(GitHub shows raw HTML; open it locally or via VSCode Live Preview.)_

**The key design principle**: the control plane, knowledge flow backend, and frontend are the stable platform. Agent pods — `fred-agents` or any team's own pod built with `fred-sdk` + `fred-runtime` — are independently deployable and register themselves with the control plane. You can ship new agents without touching the platform.

> `agentic-backend` is still present during migration but no new features go there. Execution moves to `fred-agents` / `fred-runtime`; product/session/admin moves to `control-plane-backend`. See [`docs/backlog/BACKLOG.md`](./docs/swift/backlog/BACKLOG.md) for migration status.

## Getting started

To ensure a smooth first-time experience, Fred’s maintainers designed Dev Container/Native startup to require no additional external components (except, of course, to LLM APIs).

By default, using either Dev Container or native startup:

- Fred stores all data locally using **SQLite** for SQL/metadata and **ChromaDB** for vectors/embeddings. (DuckDB has been deprecated.) Data includes metrics, chat conversations, document uploads, and embeddings.
- Authentication and authorization are mocked.

> **Note:**  
> Accross all setup modes, a common requirement is to have access to Large Language Model (LLM) APIs via a model provider. Supported options include:
>
> - **Public OpenAI APIs:** Connect using your OpenAI API key.
> - **Private Ollama Server:** Host open-source models such as Mistral, Qwen, Gemma, and Phi locally or on a shared server.
> - **Private Azure AI Endpoints:** Connect using your Azure OpenAI key.
>
> Detailed instructions for configuring your chosen model provider are provided [below](#model-configuration).

### Development environment setup

Choose how you want to prepare Fred's development environment:

#### Option 1 (recommended): Let the Dev Container do it for you!

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Prefer an isolated environment with everything pre-installed?

The Dev Container setup takes care of all dependencies related to knowledge-flow backend, control-plane backend, fred-agents pod, and frontend components.

##### Prerequisites

| Tool                                                                | Purpose                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Docker** / Docker Desktop                                         | Runs the container                  |
| **VS Code**                                                         | Primary IDE                         |
| **Dev Containers extension** (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`) | Opens the repo inside the container |

##### Open the container

1. Clone (or open) the repository in VS Code.
2. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> → **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**.

When the terminal prompt appears, the workspace is ready but you still need to run the different services with `make run` as specified in the [next section](#start-fred-components). Ports `8000` (fred-agents pod), `8111` (Knowledge Flow backend), `8222` (Control Plane backend), and `5173` (Frontend) are automatically forwarded to the host.

##### Rebuilds & troubleshooting

- Rebuild the container: <kbd>F1</kbd> → _Dev Containers: Rebuild Container_
- Dependencies feel stale? Delete the relevant `.venv` or `frontend/node_modules` inside the container, then rerun the associated `make` target.
- Need to change API keys or models? Update the backend `.env` files inside the container and restart the relevant service. See [Model configuration](#model-configuration) for more details.

##### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThalesGroup/fred.git
cd fred
```

> Note: the PPTX vision enrichment path in `knowledge-flow-backend` requires LibreOffice to be installed locally and the `soffice` command to be available in `PATH`. On Debian/Ubuntu, this can be installed with `apt install libreoffice`.

</details>

#### Advanced developer tips

> Prerequisites:
>
> - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
> - VS Code extensions:
>   - **Python** (ms-python.python)
>   - **Pylance** (ms-python.vscode-pylance)

To get full VS Code Python support (linting, IntelliSense, debugging, etc.) across our repo, we provide:

<details>
  <summary>1. A VS Code workspace file `fred.code-workspace` that loads all sub‑projects.</summary>

After cloning the repo, you can open Fred's VS Code workspace with `code .vscode/fred.code-workspace`

When you open Fred's VS Code workspace, VS Code will load these folders:

- `fred` – repo-wide files and scripts
- `apps/fred-agents` – first-party agent pod
- `apps/control-plane-backend` – control plane backend
- `knowledge-flow-backend` – knowledge flow backend
- `libs/fred-core`, `libs/fred-sdk`, `libs/fred-runtime` – shared libraries
- `frontend` – React UI
</details>

<details>
  <summary>2. Per‑folder `.vscode/settings.json` files in each Python backend to pin the interpreter.</summary>

Each backend ships its own virtual environment under .venv. We’ve added a per‑folder VS Code setting (see for instance `apps/fred-agents/.vscode/settings.json`) to automatically pick it:

This ensures that as soon as you open a Python file inside any backend or library folder, VS Code will:

- Activate that folder’s virtual environment
- Provide linting, IntelliSense, formatting, and debugging using the correct Python
</details>

### Model configuration

#### Model configuration (Agent pods)

Model configuration for agent pods lives in **`apps/fred-agents/config/models_catalog.yaml`** (and equivalently in any third-party pod). This file is separate from `configuration.yaml` and owns the full model setup: named profiles, provider settings, shared HTTP client limits, and routing rules.

**Profiles** are named model configurations. Each profile declares a provider, a model name, and optional settings (temperature, timeouts, retries). Profiles are referenced by `profile_id`.

**Defaults** declare which profile to use per capability when no rule matches:

```yaml
default_profile_by_capability:
  chat: default.chat.openai.prod
  language: default.language.openai.prod
```

**Routing rules** allow policy-based model selection based on team, agent, or operation context. Rules are evaluated in order; the first match wins:

```yaml
rules:
  - rule_id: team-a-uses-ollama
    capability: chat
    team_id: team-a
    operation: routing
    target_profile_id: chat.ollama.mistral

  - rule_id: graph-g1-json-validation
    capability: chat
    agent_id: internal.graph.g1
    operation: json_validation_fc
    target_profile_id: chat.azure_apim.gpt4o
```

This makes it possible to route different teams, agents, or operation types to different models — including mixing providers — without changing any agent code.

For details on all supported match criteria (`team_id`, `agent_id`, `user_id`, `operation`, `purpose`) see [`docs/platform/LLM_ROUTING_FRED.md`](./docs/swift/platform/LLM_ROUTING_FRED.md).

#### Set it up according to your development environment

All backends rely on `.env` files for secrets and `configuration.yaml` / `models_catalog.yaml` for settings:

- fred-agents pod: `apps/fred-agents/config/.env`, `configuration.yaml`, and `models_catalog.yaml`
- Knowledge Flow backend: `apps/knowledge-flow-backend/config/.env` and `configuration.yaml`
- Control Plane backend: `apps/control-plane-backend/config/.env` and `configuration.yaml`

1. **Copy the templates (skip if they already exist).**

   ```bash
   cp apps/fred-agents/config/.env.template apps/fred-agents/config/.env
   cp apps/knowledge-flow-backend/config/.env.template apps/knowledge-flow-backend/config/.env
   cp apps/control-plane-backend/config/.env.template apps/control-plane-backend/config/.env
   ```

2. **Edit the `.env` files** to set the API keys, base URLs, and deployment names that match your model provider.

3. **Update each backend’s `configuration.yaml`** so the `provider`, `name`, and optional settings align with the same provider. Use the recipes below as a starting point.

<details>
  <summary>OpenAI</summary>

> **Note:** Out of the box, Fred is configured to use OpenAI public APIs with the following models:
>
> - fred-agents pod: chat model `gpt-4o` (or whatever profile is set as default in `models_catalog.yaml`)
> - knowledge flow backend: chat model `gpt-4o-mini` and embedding model `text-embedding-3-large`
>
> If you plan to use Fred with these OpenAI models, you don't have to perform the `yq` commands below—just make sure the `.env` files contain your key.

- fred-agents pod configuration

  Edit `apps/fred-agents/config/models_catalog.yaml`. Find the profile you want to use (or add one) and set `provider: openai` and `name: <your-openai-model-name>`. Then set it as the `default_profile_by_capability.chat` default.

- knowledge flow backend configuration
  - Chat model

    ```bash
    yq eval '.chat_model.provider = "openai"' -i apps/knowledge-flow-backend/config/configuration.yaml
    yq eval '.chat_model.name = "<your-openai-model-name>"' -i apps/knowledge-flow-backend/config/configuration.yaml
    yq eval 'del(.chat_model.settings)' -i apps/knowledge-flow-backend/config/configuration.yaml
    ```

  - Embedding model

    ```bash
    yq eval '.embedding_model.provider = "openai"' -i apps/knowledge-flow-backend/config/configuration.yaml
    yq eval '.embedding_model.name = "<your-openai-model-name>"' -i apps/knowledge-flow-backend/config/configuration.yaml
    yq eval 'del(.embedding_model.settings)' -i apps/knowledge-flow-backend/config/configuration.yaml
    ```

- Copy-paste your `OPENAI_API_KEY` value in both `.env` files.

  > ⚠️ An `OPENAI_API_KEY` from a free OpenAI account unfortunately does not work.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Azure OpenAI</summary>

- fred-agents pod configuration

  Edit `apps/fred-agents/config/models_catalog.yaml`. Find or add a profile with `provider: azure-openai`, `name: <deployment-name>`, and `settings.azure_endpoint` / `settings.azure_openai_api_version`. Set it as the `default_profile_by_capability.chat` default.

- knowledge flow backend configuration
  - Chat model

    ```bash
    yq eval '.chat_model.provider = "azure-openai"' -i apps/knowledge-flow-backend/config/configuration.yaml
    yq eval '.chat_model.name = "<your-azure-openai-deployment-name>"' -i apps/knowledge-flow-backend/config/configuration.yaml
    yq eval 'del(.chat_model.settings)' -i apps/knowledge-flow-backend/config/configuration.yaml
    yq eval '.chat_model.settings.azure_endpoint = "<your-azure-openai-endpoint>"' -i apps/knowledge-flow-backend/config/configuration.yaml
    yq eval '.chat_model.settings.azure_openai_api_version = "<your-azure-openai-api-version>"' -i apps/knowledge-flow-backend/config/configuration.yaml
    ```

  - Embedding model

    ```bash
    yq eval '.embedding_model.provider = "azure-openai"' -i apps/knowledge-flow-backend/config/configuration.yaml
    yq eval '.embedding_model.name = "<your-azure-openai-deployment-name>"' -i apps/knowledge-flow-backend/config/configuration.yaml
    yq eval 'del(.embedding_model.settings)' -i apps/knowledge-flow-backend/config/configuration.yaml
    yq eval '.embedding_model.settings.azure_endpoint = "<your-azure-openai-endpoint>"' -i apps/knowledge-flow-backend/config/configuration.yaml
    yq eval '.embedding_model.settings.azure_openai_api_version = "<your-azure-openai-api-version>"' -i apps/knowledge-flow-backend/config/configuration.yaml
    ```

  - Vision model

    ```bash
    yq eval '.vision_model.provider = "azure-openai"' -i knowledge_flow_backend/config/configuration.yaml
    yq eval '.vision_model.name = "<your-azure-openai-deployment-name>"' -i knowledge_flow_backend/config/configuration.yaml
    yq eval 'del(.vision_model.settings)' -i knowledge_flow_backend/config/configuration.yaml
    yq eval '.vision_model.settings.azure_endpoint = "<your-azure-openai-endpoint>"' -i knowledge_flow_backend/config/configuration.yaml
    yq eval '.vision_model.settings.azure_openai_api_version = "<your-azure-openai-api-version>"' -i knowledge_flow_backend/config/configuration.yaml
    ```

- Copy-paste your `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` value in both `.env` files.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Ollama</summary>

- fred-agents pod configuration

  Edit `apps/fred-agents/config/models_catalog.yaml`. Add or update a profile with `provider: openai`, `name: <your-ollama-model-name>`, and `settings.base_url: <your-ollama-endpoint>`. Set it as the `default_profile_by_capability.chat` default.

- knowledge flow backend configuration
  - Chat model

### Start Fred components

```bash
# standalone mode (single-process backend: control-plane + agentic + knowledge-flow)
make run-app
```

```bash
# split APIs mode (agentic:8000, knowledge-flow:8111, control-plane:8222)
make run-multi
```

```bash
# default command (alias of `run-app`)
make run
```

```bash
# backward-compatible alias
make run-app-multi
```

```bash
# split APIs mode + all Temporal workers (requires Temporal running)
make run-multi-workers
```

Run a single backend API from repository root:

```bash
make run-control-plane
make run-fred-agents
make run-knowledge-flow
```

Or run each component from its own folder:

```bash
# knowledge-flow backend
cd apps/knowledge-flow-backend && make run
```

```bash
# fred-agents pod
cd apps/fred-agents && make run
```

```bash
# control-plane backend
cd apps/control-plane-backend && make run
```

```bash
# frontend
cd frontend && make run
```

### Head for the Fred UI!

Open <http://localhost:5173> in your browser.

## k3d Local Deployment

Fred can be deployed locally into a [k3d](https://k3d.io) Kubernetes cluster using Helm. This mode mirrors a production-like setup while keeping everything on your machine.

### Prerequisites

| Tool        | Purpose                    | Install                                                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Docker**  | Container runtime          | [docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)                                    |
| **k3d**     | Local Kubernetes clusters  | `curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k3d-io/k3d/main/install.sh \| bash` |
| **Helm**    | Kubernetes package manager | [docs](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)                                    |
| **kubectl** | Kubernetes CLI             | [docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)                                |

You also need the infrastructure stack deployed via the [fred-deployment-factory](https://github.com/ThalesGroup/fred-deployment-factory) repository. Follow its README to run `make k3d-up`.

### Host Configuration

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You **must** add `keycloak` to your `/etc/hosts` file so your browser can reach the Keycloak server running inside k3d:
>
> ```
> 127.0.0.1 localhost keycloak
> ```
>
> Without this entry, authentication will not work because the browser cannot resolve the `keycloak` hostname.

### Deploying

```bash
# 1. Set your OpenAI API key in the values file
#    Edit deploy/local/k3d/values-local.yaml and fill OPENAI_API_KEY

# 2. Build, import images into k3d, and deploy via Helm (all-in-one)
make k3d-deploy
```

### Makefile Targets

| Target                      | Description                                                                                                 |

### Accessing the Application

Once deployed, open <http://localhost:8088> in your browser. The Traefik Ingress routes all traffic through a single port:

| Path                | Service                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `/`                 | Frontend                  |
| `/fred/agents/v2/*` | fred-agents pod           |
| `/knowledge-flow/*` | Knowledge Flow backend    |
| `/control-plane/*`  | Control Plane backend     |
| `/realms/*`         | Keycloak (authentication) |

Other infrastructure services remain accessible on their usual ports:

| Service               | URL                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Keycloak              | <http://keycloak:8080>  |
| Temporal UI           | <http://localhost:8233> |
| MinIO Console         | <http://localhost:9001> |
| OpenSearch Dashboards | <http://localhost:5601> |

## Production mode

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Access-control reminder (shared environments):**
> Keycloak app roles and team ReBAC rights are different controls.
> For the Fred access model and deployment bootstrap rules, see [`docs/platform/REBAC.md`](./docs/swift/platform/REBAC.md).

For production deployments (Kubernetes, VMs, on-prem or cloud), refer to:

- [`docs/platform/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`](./docs/swift/platform/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) – high-level deployment guide (components, configuration, external dependencies).
- [`docs/platform/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_OPENSEARCH.md`](./docs/swift/platform/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_OPENSEARCH.md) – OpenSearch-specific requirements. Use this only if you choose OpenSearch over the new PostgreSQL/pgvector option.
- [`docs/platform/REBAC.md`](./docs/swift/platform/REBAC.md) – high-level access model (RBAC/ReBAC/organization/bootstrap).

The rest of this `README.md` focuses on local developer setup and model configuration.

## Agent authoring (v2 SDK)

Fred includes a structured agent authoring SDK designed for domain engineers and platform teams who need to write reliable, testable agents without re-implementing execution infrastructure.

The v2 SDK provides two authoring styles:

- **ReAct / profile agents** — for focused, tool-driven agents with a small state surface. Declare a role, a tool set, and a few instructions. The SDK owns the execution loop.
- **Graph agents** — for multi-step business workflows with explicit state, conditional routing, and human-in-the-loop confirmation gates. The business flow is expressed as a typed graph; the SDK handles streaming, checkpointing, and HITL interrupts.

Both styles support MCP tool integration and run on the same runtime.

Start with the [agent authoring guide (v2)](./docs/swift/authoring/AGENTS.md). For the design philosophy behind the SDK, see [SDK V2 positioning](./docs/swift/authoring/SDK-V2-POSITIONING.md).

## Agent coding academy

The [academy](./academy/README.md) contains sample MCP servers and standalone applications to experiment with agent development outside the main platform. The [fred-samples](https://github.com/ThalesGroup/fred-samples) repository provides ready-to-run example pods built with `fred-sdk` + `fred-runtime`.

### Advanced Integrations

- Enable Keycloak or another OIDC provider for authentication

  > **Frontend security is backend-driven.**  
  > The frontend first loads static `/config.json`, then calls the public control-plane `/control-plane/v1/frontend/config` endpoint for the effective `user_auth` and `gcu_version` values. Real Keycloak OIDC is enabled from the backend `security.user` configuration; when disabled for local dev, the frontend mints local dev tokens while keeping the same app code paths. Static branding stays in frontend `config.json` `properties`. See [`apps/frontend/README.md`](./apps/frontend/README.md#configuration-surfaces) for details.

- Persistence options:
  - **Laptop / dev (default):** SQLite for metadata + ChromaDB for vectors (embedded, no external services)
  - **Production:** PostgreSQL + pgvector for metadata/vectors, and optionally MinIO/S3 + OpenSearch if you prefer that stack

## Core Architecture and Licensing Clarity

The platform applications and the fred-agents pod form the default Fred deployment. By default they run self-contained on a laptop using **SQLite + ChromaDB** (no external services).

Fred is modular: you can optionally add Keycloak/OpenFGA, MinIO/S3, OpenSearch, and PostgreSQL/pgvector for production-grade persistence.

Persistence options:

- **Dev/laptop (default):** SQLite for all SQL stores, ChromaDB for vectors, local filesystem for blobs.
- **Production (recommended):** PostgreSQL + pgvector for SQL + vectors; optionally pair with MinIO/S3 + OpenSearch if you prefer that stack.

### Licensing Note

Fred's own code is released under the **Apache License 2.0**. Optional integrations (like OpenSearch) are configured externally and do not contaminate Fred's licensing.

Fred currently depends on a small number of third-party Python packages under copyleft licenses, tracked under `LICENSE-01`/`LICENSE-02`/`LICENSE-03` (see `docs/swift/data/id-legend.yaml`). Full detail, severity assessment, and remediation status for each: [docs/swift/COPYLEFT-DEPENDENCIES.md](./docs/swift/COPYLEFT-DEPENDENCIES.md).

- `pymupdf` / `pymupdf4llm` (PDF processing, `knowledge-flow-backend`) — dual-licensed **AGPL-3.0 / Artifex Commercial License**. Currently a mandatory dependency; being made optional with a non-AGPL (`docling`/`pypdf`) default path so the default distribution ships with no AGPL code (tracked in [issue #1950](https://github.com/ThalesGroup/fred/issues/1950)).
- `psycopg2-binary` / `psycopg` (PostgreSQL driver, `fred-core` / `knowledge-flow-backend`) — **LGPL-3.0-only**, used as an unmodified, dynamically imported package (not statically linked or embedded).
- `jwcrypto` (transitive, via `python-keycloak`'s admin client, `fred-core` / `control-plane-backend` / `knowledge-flow-backend` / `fred-agents`) — **LGPL-3.0-or-later**, used as an unmodified, dynamically imported package; never directly invoked by Fred's own code (Fred's JWT verification path uses PyJWT).

If your use case requires a fully copyleft-free dependency tree, audit these packages before deployment.

See the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) for more details.
