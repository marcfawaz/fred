Input and state models for the test assistant graph agent.

This agent needs no LLM — every branch is keyword-driven so developers
can exercise every SSE event type (status, assistant_delta, HITL choice,
HITL free-text, sources, error) from a running pod without configuring
a model provider.

Trigger keywords (case-insensitive prefix match):
  echo          → simple echo reply with status events
  hitl choice   → binary HITL confirmation gate (3 options)
  hitl text     → free-text HITL input gate
  trace         → status events + streamed analytical text + mock sources
  error         → node_error path to test UI error rendering
  long          → ~30 short sentences streamed word-by-word
  files         → unified /fs round-trip: write to the agent's space, read back, list
  geo           → renders a sample GeoJSON FeatureCollection as a GeoPart ui_part
  document      → search via the document_access capability's tool
                  (context.invoke_runtime_tool), then a HITL confirm/discard
                  gate on the top hit — degrades to a helpful message when the
                  capability isn't selected on this agent instance
  (anything else) → fallback with scenario list
