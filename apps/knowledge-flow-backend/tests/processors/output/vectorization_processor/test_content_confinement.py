"""No document-content fragments in the generic app-log store (issue #2009).

`SemanticSplitter`'s anchoring loop used to log raw chunk/window text previews
at DEBUG level; those lines reach the generic, now-durable app-log store (see
docs/swift/platform/OBSERVABILITY-AND-AUDIT.md §7 — content must appear in
no observability stream). This locks in that the fix holds regardless of how
the anchoring logic is refactored later.
