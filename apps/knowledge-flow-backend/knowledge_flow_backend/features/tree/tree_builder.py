"""
Builds an indented text tree from a flat list of hierarchical document tags
(folders) plus their resolved document leaves.

Fred rationale:
- A document's tags are a list, so a document can sit under several folders at
  once (a DAG, not a strict tree). We render it as a leaf under each folder it
  belongs to -- the same way `tree`/`find` show a file reachable via more than
  one symlinked directory. No dedup needed.
- Returning a big flat JSON list of ids is hard for a caller (an LLM) to mentally
  reassemble into a filesystem shape, so we render readable indented text instead.
- When the rendering is too large for the caller's budget, we prune the deepest
  branches first rather than truncating the string mid-line, and tell the caller
  to use search or narrow `working_directory` instead of browsing everything.
- The bracketed ids in the rendering (tag ids on folders, document uids on
  leaves) are internal working identifiers for the agent's own tool calls
  (e.g. summarize by uid). They are agent-facing only — agents are instructed
  never to repeat them to the end user.

    a real document with a real uid; `_format_leaf` never has to handle a
    synthetic one.

    `tag_id` is the folder's tag id, rendered on the folder line so a caller can
    pass it back as a `tag_ids` filter. It is None for synthetic grouping
    nodes -- intermediate path segments that were never a real tag (e.g.
