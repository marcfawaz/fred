    Zero-dependency, deterministic fallback summarizer.

    - Guarantees a working summarizer when no utility LLM is configured.
    - Keeps the same interface as BaseDocSummarizer (incl. vocab_hint arg).
    - Optimized for robustness and type safety, not linguistic perfection.

    Behavior:
    - Abstract: pick highest "density" sentences (ratio of alpha tokens) until word budget.
    - Tokens: crude n-gram frequency (2–4 grams) plus strong unigrams, de-duplicated, lowercased.
