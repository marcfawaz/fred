**v2.1.4** — 2026-07-19

- **Summary**

  Production observability and capability-admin consolidation release for the GKE validation campaign.
  This release narrows Fred’s runtime surface and clarifies the production observability target:
  Fred emits structured application/KPI logs and metrics, but no longer exposes its own raw log
  exploration UI, endpoint, or agent tool. Log exploration is delegated to OpenSearch Dashboards;
  KPIs/metrics are exposed for Prometheus scraping. The release also improves capability-admin
  health/impact visibility so platform administrators can see which agents are affected by
  capability availability changes before or after they happen.

- **Features**

  - Capability admin health now distinguishes healthy, suspended, and unknown/unreachable agent impact, with drill-downs for affected instances.
  - Capability default/team/personal-scope changes now report suspended/revived agent impact in the admin UI.
  - Production configs are consolidated around the current target deployment posture for Control Plane, Knowledge Flow, workers, and Fred Agents.

- **Security / Observability**

  - Generic application/KPI logs remain emitted and storable in OpenSearch, but security/audit events stay structurally separated from the generic application log store.
  - Generic log records now carry a closed structural category (`application` or `kpi`) derived from logger identity, never from message text.
  - KPI/log sink writes are resilient/fail-open so an unavailable observability backend does not break business requests.
  - Sensitive content confinement was hardened so prompts, responses, tool arguments, and document fragments are not written into KPI/log records.
  - OpenSearch Ops surfaces remain gated behind platform-observer authorization.

**v2.1.3** — 2026-07-16

- **Summary**

This release hardens the import swift contract in order to safely be used a first production release.

- **Improvement**

  - make the swift import production ready (#1993)

**v2.1.2** — 2026-07-16

- **Summary**

  Follow-up hardening on the v2.1.1 bootstrap/provisioning candidate. Closes the AUTHZ-07
  chart secret-boundary release gate and consolidates its remaining review notes into the
  canonical AUTHZ-07/OPS-04 backlogs. No application behavior change. (AUTHZ-07, #1991)

- **Security**

  - The Control Plane's Alembic migration Job no longer receives `FRED_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` (or any other app-only `extraEnvVars`) — scoped to the Deployment only, with CI now proving exactly one rendering location (AUTHZ-07, #1991)

**v2.1.1** — 2026-07-15

- **Summary**

  Root platform-admin bootstrap and declarative platform provisioning. A fresh Fred
  deployment now creates its first `platform_admin` through a one-time, secret-gated
  bootstrap page instead of a config-seeded subject list, and every subsequent
  platform/team role can be provisioned declaratively via a `users.json` import bundle.
  (AUTHZ-07, #1986, #1987)

- **Features**

  - Root platform-admin bootstrap: a one-time, deploy-secret-gated flow (env var or file, Kubernetes-Secret-safe) grants the very first `platform_admin`, replacing the removed config-seeded `platform_admin_subjects`/`platform_observer_subjects` path (AUTHZ-07, #1987)
  - Declarative platform provisioning: a `users.json` import bundle grants platform and cumulative team roles directly, reconciling roles on both new and pre-existing teams (AUTHZ-07, #1987)
  - Platform import outcomes are now visible in Activity — a partial "with warnings" import is distinguishable from full success, with per-phase granted/skipped/processed counters (AUTHZ-07, #1987)

- **Bug Fixes**

  - Fix `BootstrapGuard` trapping auth/ReBAC-disabled deployments (the default insecure/dev config) on a bootstrap form that could never succeed (AUTHZ-07, #1987)
  - Fail closed instead of silently succeeding when a `users.json` import runs with ReBAC disabled (AUTHZ-07, #1987)
  - Normalize the env-sourced bootstrap secret (strip trailing newline) so Kubernetes-Secret-backed tokens compare correctly (AUTHZ-07, #1987)

**v2.1.0** — 2026-07-13

- **Summary**

  Authorization milestone. Fred's authorization model is now fully self-owned: Keycloak
  authenticates identity only (login, JWT, stable `sub`), and every platform and team
  permission — `platform_admin`/`platform_observer`, `team_admin`/`team_editor`/`team_analyst`/
  `team_member` — is a stored OpenFGA relation, never derived from a Keycloak role or group.
  Team roles are now cumulative (one person can hold several roles on the same team at once),
  and teams are no longer backed by Keycloak groups at all — a team is purely an
  OpenFGA-governed registry entry. (AUTHZ-05, AUTHZ-06, #1957)

- **Features**

  - Keycloak is identity-only; Fred/OpenFGA owns all platform and team authorization, with no legacy role/group bridge remaining (AUTHZ-05, #1957)
  - Team roles are cumulative — a user may hold `team_admin`, `team_editor`, and `team_analyst` on the same team at once, each granted and revoked independently (AUTHZ-06, #1957)
  - Teams fully decoupled from Keycloak — team creation, membership, and role management are pure OpenFGA operations (AUTHZ-05, #1957)
  - Platform-admin-gated team registry governance: list every team, delete a team, rescue an orphaned team left with no admin (AUTHZ-05, #1957)

- **Security**

  - Closed a live escalation where any Keycloak `admin` role holder implicitly became `owner` of every team (AUTHZ-05, #1957)
  - Closed an organization-level content bypass that let any global `editor` role holder read or process any team's content (AUTHZ-05, #1957)

**v2.0.2** — 2026-07-06

- **Summary**

  RGPD-ready increment. Deleting a conversation now **provably erases it** — its
  history, checkpoints, and attachments are removed across every store, not just
  hidden. Teams get a **Data & Retention** setting to defer erasure by a chosen
  window (capped by the platform), and platform/team admins get an **erasure
  schedule** showing what is scheduled, in progress, and completed.

  Security remediation increment. Sweeps the open Dependabot and CodeQL alerts on
  the `swift` branch: vulnerable frontend and Python dependencies are upgraded,
  an unused developer tool is removed, CI token scope is tightened, and the
  published libraries are re-released with the patched dependency floors so
  downstream agent pods cannot resolve the vulnerable stack. (#1917)

- **Features**

  - Data & Retention team setting: choose how long deleted conversations are kept before full erasure, within the platform-allowed limit (CTRLP-12, #1914)
  - Erasure schedule view for platform and team admins — scheduled (with due date), in progress, completed; a wedged erasure is flagged as **stalled** instead of failing silently (CTRLP-12, #1914)
  - Governed evaluation runs on real conversations within the retention window (CTRLP-12, #1914)

- **Security**

  - Patch vulnerable frontend dependencies — `react-router`, `dompurify`, `vite`, `http-proxy-middleware`, `echarts` (5→6), `js-yaml`, `@babel/core` (#1917)
  - Bump **FastAPI 0.116.1 → 0.139.0** and **Starlette → 1.3.1** across all backends, with patched floors baked into the published lib bounds — `fred-core` 3.4.1, `fred-runtime` 3.3.1, `fred-sdk` 3.3.1 (#1917)
  - Remove the unused `developer_tools/ai_tools`, retiring its dependency alerts (#1917)
  - Set least-privilege `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions on the migration-check workflow; triage and dismiss the remaining CodeQL findings as documented false positives (#1917)

- **Bug Fixes**

  - Deleting a conversation always converges: if the erase can't complete immediately, it is hidden right away and retried automatically until fully erased — never left half-deleted (CTRLP-12, #1914)
  - Retrying or double-clicking a scheduled deletion no longer creates duplicate entries in the erasure schedule (CTRLP-12, #1914)
  - Fix the team banner upload breaking the build after the generated API client was refreshed (#1917)

**v2.0.1** — 2026-06-28

- **Summary**

  Security milestone. As of this release, Fred's runtime security model is **final and
  solid**: each agent pod is the execution authority and authorizes every request itself —
  validating the Keycloak JWT and running a pod-side OpenFGA ReBAC check (audience and
  team-binding enforced). It introduces the opt-in `security.profile: c3` hardened posture
  (fail-closed: strict JWT issuer/audience validation, no no-security/mock-admin, ReBAC
  required). Alongside the security work it ships a native Google Cloud Storage content
  backend (Workload Identity), a new PDF extractor, evaluation-campaign support on the
  task/event-bus API, config-driven branding, and human-friendly chat tool-call traces.

- **Features**

  - Hardened runtime authorization model, now final: each agent pod authorizes every request via the Keycloak JWT + a pod-side OpenFGA ReBAC check, with audience and team-binding enforced (RUNTIME-07, #1862)
  - Opt-in `security.profile: c3` hardened posture — fail-closed strict JWT issuer/audience validation, no no-security/mock-admin, ReBAC required (RUNTIME-07, #1862)
  - Native Google Cloud Storage content backend via ADC / Workload Identity for the content store and virtual filesystem (#1805)
  - Evaluation-campaign support on the task and event-bus API (#1827)
  - Config-driven branding: frontend branding wired from `config_json` (#1842, #1851)
  - Scheduled live-stack validation of GKE releases via an admin self-test harness (VALID-02, #1837)

- **Improvements**

  - New PDF extractor for higher-fidelity ingestion (#1790)
  - Human-friendly tool-call labels in the chat trace (CHAT-12 / CHAT-14, #1816, #1824)
  - Durable agent runtime store on Postgres, replacing the ephemeral sqlite path (#1862)
  - Repeatable review protocol and audit signals; RFC/doc cleanup pass (#1841, #1849)
  - Remove dead frontend components and untrack the benchmark binary (#1856)
  - RFC for a deterministic Excel extraction pipeline (INGEST-02, #1845)
  - Flag AGPL dependency pending removal (#1846)

  - Fix typos in translation files

**v2.0.0** — 2026-06-24

- **Summary**

  Major release. This version establishes the **agentic pod** architecture: agents are
  now built and deployed as standalone services in their own repositories — the control
  plane discovers them, enrolls their agents, and routes execution to them, with no
  dependency on the Fred monorepo. It also ships an in-app KPI analytics dashboard, a
  substantially reworked chat UI (attachments, prompts, voice dictation, reasoning
  traces), a unified virtual filesystem with provenance, and a richer ingestion stack
  (audio/video transcription, faster PDF extraction). Helm packaging is hardened with
  generated config schemas and Gateway API support.

- **Features**

  - Agentic pod architecture — design and run agents as independent HTTP services in their own repository; the control plane is the sole authority for pod discovery and agent enrollment (see `docs/swift/SWIFT_ARCHITECTURE.md`)
  - KPI analytics dashboard — active users, conversations & messages, agents, resources (OBSERV-02, #1722)
  - Reworked chat UI: in-chat attachments and enhanced composer (#1712), wired-in prompt library (#1782), document picker and local MCP config (#1731)
