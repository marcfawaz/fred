Agent-instance suspension lifecycle (#1975, RFC AGENT-CAPABILITY §3.9).

Why this module exists:
- a broken capability must SUSPEND the agent, never silently degrade it — an
  agent missing its document-access tools would confidently answer from priors,
  and that trust failure is worse than unavailability (RFC §3.9)
- `suspended` is a platform-forced state DISTINCT from the editor's `enabled`
  toggle, carrying a typed reason (`SuspensionReason`)
- the #1971 spike proved LangGraph gives no assembly/run-time signal and that
  capability state survives a capability-less turn, so suspension is a pure
  control-plane product decision made here — not a checkpointer concern

What lives here:
- `SuspensionReason` — the three typed reasons
- `reconcile_instance_suspension(...)` — the availability reconciliation entry
  point (the proactive sweep's per-instance unit AND the documented trigger
  point #1980's ReBAC revocation calls, see below)
- `reconcile_instance_config_health(...)` — the config-invalid detection unit
  (a stored slice that no longer validates, incl. a failing `upgrade_config`)
- `suspend_instance` / `clear_suspension` — the store writes + observability

#1980 TRIGGER-POINT CONTRACT (ReBAC team scoping, sequenced AFTER #1975):
    When an enablement tuple is deleted, #1980 recomputes the set of capability
    ids the instance's team may still use, then calls
    `reconcile_instance_suspension(instance=..., store=...,
    available_capability_ids=<remaining>, revoked_reason=
    SuspensionReason.CAPABILITY_ACCESS_REVOKED, kpi_writer=...)`. #1975 does NOT
    perform any ReBAC check itself — it only exposes this entry point. The
    default `revoked_reason` (`CAPABILITY_UNAVAILABLE`) covers the
    manifest-change / pod-rollback path driven by the reconciliation sweep.
