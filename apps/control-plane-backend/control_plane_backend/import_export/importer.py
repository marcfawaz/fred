"""Kea→Swift import service (MIGR-05).

Reads a KBundle and writes the migrated data into the swift control-plane DB.
Emits MigrationTaskEvent progress events so the frontend SSE stream stays live.

All three write phases (agents, tags, metadata) share a single SQLAlchemy
transaction opened against the same AsyncEngine.  Any failure rolls back
everything atomically — no partial state is left behind.

Scope (current snapshot):
- Agents   → agent_instance rows (MAPPED only; IGNORED silently skipped; GAP warned)
- Tags     → tag rows (preserving tag_id, owner_id, doc JSON)
- Metadata → metadata rows (preserving document_uid and doc JSON;
             content/vectors already in S3+OpenSearch via MIGR-06)
- Team metadata → team_metadata rows (branding + per-team retention, CTRLP-12;
             swift-native snapshots only, idempotent skip-if-present)
- Users    → two-phase declarative provisioning (AUTHZ-07 Part 8 §40.2,
             `PLATFORM-IMPORT-RFC.md` §6, reconciliation fix AUTHZ-07 Step 2)
             from the top-level `users.json` bundle entry, run outside the DB
             transaction above (after it, so role grants may reference teams
             the same bundle just created).
             Phase 1 (identity) creates a Keycloak user for any bundle entry
             that has no existing identity AND carries a `password` — an
             entry with no `password` is assumed to already exist and is
             never force-created. Phase 2 (role) resolves username → sub and
             grants every team/platform role the bundle declares. A
             brand-new team's *initial* `team_admin`(s) is always seeded at
             creation (`teams.service.create_team`'s own bootstrap
             capability). Every other team-scoped grant — `team_editor`,
             `team_analyst`, `team_member`, or any role on a team that
             already existed before this import — is written by a private,
             import-only reconciliation primitive (`_grant_team_role_via_import`)
             that calls `RebacEngine.add_relation` directly, the same way
             `_grant_platform_role` already does for org-level roles. It
             deliberately does NOT go through the ordinary, `team_admin`-gated
             `teams.service.grant_team_member_role` — that would require the
             importing `platform_admin` to already hold `team_admin` on every
             team the bundle touches, which defeats the point of a
             declarative bundle. Team-scoped roles are still never *derived*
             from a platform role (schema.fga's `type team` comment is
             unchanged, and the ordinary team-membership APIs are untouched
             and still team-admin-bounded) — this is a narrow, private write
             path reachable only from this already `CAN_MANAGE_PLATFORM`-gated
             import flow, not a new capability exposed anywhere else.
             Fail-closed by design (AUTHZ-07 Step 2): ReBAC disabled (the
             engine is `NoopRebacEngine`, so no relation write would persist
             anything), an unknown team-role or platform-role name, a
             username still unresolved after the identity phase, or a team
             that cannot be created or resolved, each raise
             `BundleProvisioningError` and abort the users phase — a
             declared-valid bundle never ends in a silently incomplete
             `succeeded` task.
- MCP servers      → SKIP (re-seeded by deployment on swift)
- Resources/prompts → SKIP (0 rows in current exports)

Pre-conditions handled outside this module (MIGR-04 / MIGR-06):
- Keycloak users already present with the same UUIDs
- OpenFGA tuples already restored (Option A — ops bulk-copy)
- MinIO binaries and embeddings already mirrored
