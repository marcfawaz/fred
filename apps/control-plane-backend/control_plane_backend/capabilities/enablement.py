"""
Per-team capability enablement — the write path (CAPAB-01 / #1980, RFC §8.1–§8.4).

The one place that mutates capability authorization. Every write goes through
here so the RFC invariants hold in exactly one spot:

- **Write ordering (RFC §8.2):** enable = settings row THEN the `enabled` tuple
  (a half-failure leaves the capability *disabled*, never
  enabled-without-settings); disable = delete the tuple, KEEP the row.
- **Revocation → suspension (#1975 seam):** when a team loses `can_use` on a
  capability, its dependent agent instances are suspended
  (`CAPABILITY_ACCESS_REVOKED`) through `reconcile_instance_suspension` — the
  entry point #1975 exposed for exactly this.
- **Callers check only `can_use`/`can_manage`** — this module writes the
  structural tuples (`organization` anchor / `enabled` / `disabled` /
  `default_on`) they never touch directly.

    instances` fakes the available set as `selected - {capability_id}` because a
    revoke knows exactly what it removed. A grant knows only what it ADDED — it
    cannot conclude the instance is healthy, because a SECOND capability may
    still be revoked or missing from the pod. So the caller must supply the real
    availability facts and let `reconcile_instance_suspension` decide: it clears
    only when NOTHING is missing, and re-suspends otherwise.

    Safe on the reasons it must not touch: the reconcile clears only
    `AVAILABILITY_REASONS`, so a `capability_config_invalid` suspension survives
    untouched — only a successful save clears that (RFC §3.9). Passing the real
    sets rather than a synthetic one is what makes that guarantee hold here.

    `usable_capability_ids=None` means ReBAC is disabled (no scoping). An

    that list — see `_suspend_instance_for_revoked_capability`), so
    `reconcile_instance_suspension`'s selected-capability diff would never see
