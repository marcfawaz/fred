Resting capability impact — who is broken RIGHT NOW, and by what (CAPAB-01).

Why this module exists:
- `agent_instance.suspension_reason` records WHY an instance is suspended, never
  WHICH capability did it. An instance broken by `capa1` while also selecting
  `capa2` would be miscounted against `capa2` by any `suspension_reason IS NOT
  NULL AND capa2 IN selected` query. Attribution is therefore DERIVED, never
  stored: `selected_capability_ids` minus what the instance's space may
  currently use, minus what its pod currently advertises.
- the same derivation answers two questions the admin surface asks, so it lives
  in exactly one place (both callers below):
    1. resting health  — "how many instances does capability X break today?"
    2. impact preview  — "how many WOULD X break if I revoked it now?"

Why not reuse the write path's shortcut: `suspend_dependent_instances` fakes the
available set as `selected - {capability_id}` because a revoke KNOWS what it
just took away. A resting read has no such luxury — it must ask ReBAC and the
pods what is true now. That asymmetry is exactly why this module exists.

Availability is the CONJUNCTION of two independent facts (both required):
- ReBAC `can_use` — the space is authorized for the capability
- pod manifest — the capability is actually shipped by the instance's runtime

Unreachable pod = UNKNOWN, never "broken": the reconciliation sweep skips such
instances (`skipped_unreachable`) rather than suspending them on a transient
outage (#1975, RFC §3.9), and this read reports the same way. Telling an admin
"12 agents broken" because a pod is restarting would be a lie with consequences.
