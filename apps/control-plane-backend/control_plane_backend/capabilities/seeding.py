Capability default seeding (CAPAB-01 / #1980, RFC AGENT-CAPABILITY §8.3).

One seed point, idempotent:

- **Registration seeding** — a `manifest.team_scope: default_on` capability gets
  its `default_on` tuple written the FIRST time it is registered (detected by
  the absence of its organization anchor). Afterwards the tuple is runtime state
  owned by admins, so seeding never re-writes it. The `default_policy: explicit`
  deployment flag skips all seeds; a capability with required team settings can
  never be default-on (§8.2).

Personal-space seeding (formerly `seed_personal_team_capabilities`, driven by
`capabilities.personal_defaults`) was withdrawn by the 2026-07-16 §8.4
amendment: the personal-space class is now pure FGA runtime state
(`personal_on`/`personal_disabled`), admin-toggleable via
`PUT /admin/capabilities/{id}/personal-scope`. No seeding, no backfill.
