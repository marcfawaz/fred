"""
Read-side capability authorization (CAPAB-01 / #1980, RFC §8.1).

The `can_use` half consumed by the catalog listing and the agent-save check.
Callers here NEVER touch the structural tuples — they only ask `can_use`.
Every capability id is FGA-gated the same way — an MCP-backed capability's id
is the plain catalog server id now (#1988, supersedes the `mcp:<id>` bypass),
so it is an ordinary `capability` object in the FGA type and is scoped here
like any other.

The check SUBJECT IS THE TEAM the agent belongs to, never the browsing user:
enablement is a per-team fact, and a user-subject check would answer "is this
user in ANY enabled team", leaking a capability enabled for one of the user's
teams into every team context they browse (and letting them save it there).
The user's membership in the team is enforced by the route (`get_team_by_id`)
before these helpers run. Each check injects the derived
`organization:fred#team@team:<id>` reverse edge as a CONTEXTUAL tuple so the
`default_on` path resolves for team subjects — every team belongs to the
singleton organization, so the edge is never persisted.
