"""
Resting capability impact + the grant-side revive seam (CAPAB-01, #1975).

Covers the two things the health/impact work turns on:
- attribution is DERIVED, so an instance broken by capa1 must NOT count against
  capa2 even when it selects both (the exact miscount the stored
  `suspension_reason` cannot avoid);
- a GRANT revives the suspensions it resolves — the bug where re-enabling a
  capability left its agents suspended forever because only the never-scheduled
  reconciliation sweep could clear them.
