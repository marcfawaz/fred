# Fred Agentic Backend

Fred is a flexible agentic backend that makes it easy to build, compose, and operate expert agents — including multi-agent systems with a planning **leader** agent.

It provides:

- ⚙️ A powerful runtime to orchestrate **domain-specific experts** and **leaders**
- 🧠 Built-in support for OpenAI, Azure, Ollama, and other LLM providers
- 🧪 Local development defaults for quick experimentation
- 🔌 Optional integration with external backends (MCP servers, OpenSearch, MinIO, etc.)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

You can spin up the backend in seconds:

```bash
make run
```

This will:

- Start the API server (FastAPI)
- Use default in-memory and local storage components
- Let you interact with agents right away — no external dependencies required

## Configuration Contract (All Fred Backends)

Agentic follows the same startup configuration contract as Knowledge Flow and Control Plane.

Read: [`docs/CONFIGURATION_AND_POLICY_CONVENTIONS.md`](../docs/CONFIGURATION_AND_POLICY_CONVENTIONS.md)

Key point: always use `ENV_FILE` + `CONFIG_FILE` (same names in every backend).

## 🧰 Temporal Worker (Long Jobs)

For long-running or isolated agent tasks, start the Temporal worker as a separate process:

```bash
make run-worker
```

This starts the worker only (no FastAPI server). You can also point it at a different config:

```bash
CONFIG_FILE=./config/configuration_worker.yaml make run-worker
```

## 🔐 Temporal Payload Encryption (Recommended for Prod)

Temporal stores workflow inputs in history. To protect user tokens in scheduler payloads,
enable the payload codec by setting the same key in both the API pod and worker pod:

```bash
export FRED_TEMPORAL_CODEC_KEY="..."
```

Generate a key locally:

```bash
make temporal-key
```

## Configure Your LLM Provider (Required)

To use Fred, you must configure an LLM provider in `configuration.yaml` and `.env`. The logic is simple:
in '.env' file you provide only sensitive access keys and tokens. ALl the rest is in the yaml file.

Fred supports:

- ✅ **OpenAI**
- ✅ **Azure OpenAI**
- ✅ **Azure via API Management (APIM)**
- ✅ **Ollama** (for local models like `llama2`, `mistral`, etc.)

See [LLM Configuration](#configuring-freds-ai-model-provider) below for details.

---

## Optional External Backends

Fred is modular — it can integrate with:

- 🟤 **MCP servers** (for code execution, monitoring, document search, etc.)
- 🔍 **OpenSearch** (for persistent vector storage)
- 🪣 **MinIO** (for storing feedbacks, files)
- ☁️ **Cloud storage** (via the `context_storage` and `dao` configs)

These are optional. By default, Fred uses local file-based cache.

You can plug in real backends incrementally, agent by agent.

## 🎓 Fred Academy (Agent Examples)

If you want to learn how to build agents in Fred, start with the **Academy** samples:

- [`agentic_backend/academy/ACADEMY.md`](agentic_backend/academy/ACADEMY.md) – overview of all training steps
- Each step has its own folder and (for most) a local README:
  - `agentic_backend/academy/04_slide_maker/README.md` – slide/outline generator
  - `agentic_backend/agents/v2/demos/artifact_report/agent.py` – v2 downloadable report pattern

On GitHub, these links are clickable and let readers drill down from the top‑level README to any sample.

## Configuring Fred's AI Model Provider

Fred supports multiple AI model providers through a flexible YAML configuration and environment-based secret management.

You can choose between:

- ✅ **OpenAI** (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`)
- ✅ **Azure OpenAI** (with your own Azure deployment)
- ✅ **Azure via API Management (APIM)** (for enterprise environments using gateways)

### 📁 Step 1: Edit `configuration.yaml`

Inside the `ai.default_model` section, choose your provider.

#### 🔹 Option 1: OpenAI

```yaml
ai:
  default_model:
    provider: "openai"
    name: "gpt-4o"
    settings:
      temperature: 0.0
      max_retries: 2
      request_timeout: 30
```

#### 🔹 Option 2: Azure OpenAI

```yaml
ai:
  default_model:
    provider: "azure-openai"
    name: "fred-gpt-4o" # your Azure deployment name
    settings:
      api_version: "2024-05-01-preview"
      temperature: 0.0
      request_timeout: 30
      max_retries: 2
```

#### 🔹 Option 3: Azure OpenAI via APIM

```yaml
ai:
  default_model:
    provider: "azure-openai"
    name: "fred-gpt-4o"
    settings:
      api_version: "2024-05-01-preview"
      temperature: 0.0
      request_timeout: 30
      max_retries: 2
      azure_endpoint: "https://your-company-api.azure-api.net"
```

### 🔐 Step 2: Set Required Environment Variables in `.env`

#### ✅ For OpenAI:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

#### ✅ For Azure OpenAI:

```env
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```

Optional for Azure AD authentication:

```env
AZURE_TENANT_ID=...
AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID=...
AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

#### ✅ For Azure APIM (if used):

```env
AZURE_APIM_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY=your-subscription-key
```

## Developer Tips

- Agents can be enabled/disabled in `configuration.yaml` under `ai.agents`
- Each agent can specify its own model and MCP server config
- The leader agent coordinates other experts when enabled
- Logs are verbose by default to help with debugging

## Local Setup Only?

Yes — everything works out of the box on a developer laptop. You can later plug in production storage or APIs.
